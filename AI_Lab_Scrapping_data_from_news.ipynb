            " Thursday, July 18, 2024 1:56PM EDT Two deaths as a result of a listeriosis outbreak linked to a plant-based milk recall are in Ontario, provincial health officials confirmed Thursday. Silk brand almond milk, coconut milk, almond-coconut milk and oat milk, as well as Great Value brand almond milk, were recalled earlier this month. \"At this point in time, the Ministry of Health can confirm that 2 deaths in Ontario have been related to this outbreak,\" a spokesperson told CP24 in an email. \"The Ministry of Health is working closely with Local Public Health Agencies, Public Health Ontario, the CFIA, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada regarding the recall of these products.\" At least 12 lab-confirmed cases of listeriosis have been reported in connection with the recall, including 10 in Ontario and one each in Quebec and Nova Scotia. All of the affected products, of which there are 18, include the product code 7825 and best-before dates up to and including Oct. 4. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), products contaminated with listeria may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick and include symptoms like vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness. “Pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, the infection can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth. In severe cases of illness, people may die,” PHAC said in the recall. READ MORE: What is listeriosis, the illness recently linked to a recall of plant-based milks? Of the reported listeriosis cases in Canada, 67 per cent were reported in women and the ages of those hospitalized are between 37 and 89. PHAC said the people who became sick developed symptoms between August 2023 and early July 2024. Health officials warned that more infections may continue to be reported as the illness reporting period for this outbreak is between nine and 35 days. In a statement issued Wednesday, the president of Danone Canada, Frédéric Guichard, said all 15 of the Silk products have been removed from shelves across the country. \"The news in this notice is devastating and our most sincere sympathies go out to the families and loved ones during this difficult time,” he said. It’s unclear if the three Great Value products, which are produced by Walmart, are still on the shelves. If you believe you have one of the affected products in your home, PHAC advises to throw the items out or return them to where they were purchased. \n",

            " Wednesday, July 17, 2024 5:27PM EDT A massive rainstorm which flooded roads, basements and businesses in the city Tuesday is raising questions about Toronto's preparedness when it comes to major weather events. The storm, which dumped a month's worth of rain on the city in a matter of hours, overwhelmed sewer systems and waterways, causing damage and hampering transit. While such storms are rare, they are not unheard of. Another storm about a decade ago in 2013 caused major flooding, submerging vehicles and necessitating the rescue of passengers from a half-submerged GO Train. With more adverse weather expected due to climate change, the city has undertaken flood mitigation work over the past decade, including a massive project to reroute the mouth of the Don River to add flood protection in the Port Lands – a project which marked a major milestone just last week and which is expected to be compete by the end of this year. But the fact that the city has undertaken flood protection work over the past few years left some wondering why the city was then so overwhelmed by Tuesday's storm. Speaking on CTV Your Morning Wednesday, Mayor Olivia Chow said flood mitigation is at various stages of work in areas across the city, with some projects still waiting for dollars to flow. \"The west area, still some of those homeowners can't even get insurance for their basements because they've been flooding so much,\" Chow said. \"So we're waiting for the federal government to join us to really do flood mitigation measures in the west end of the city. It's about $300 million, and they've said yes, it's just we're waiting for the funds to flow.\" Chow said the city also has \"very, very aggressive\" plans to build more housing in the East Harbour area, east of the Don River, but is also waiting on about $200 million from the federal government for flood protection. However she did note that Ottawa has contributed in a \"big\" way to flood protection with the project to naturalize the mouth of the Don River. One of the massive concrete \"plugs\" separating the newly-created stretch of river was removed last week. Once all of the plugs have been removed, the river will flow out through the new mouth, instead of emptying into the narrow Keating Channel. \"The last plug about to be pulled out in the next couple of months, that will allow the Don River to flow into Lake Ontario, and that would ease a lot of the flooding,\" Chow said. \"So it's happening, but we're almost there.\" In a post, Waterfront Toronto confirmed that while a small amount of water from the Don River entered the new stretch of river, the project was not at a stage of completion that would have allowed water to flow through to the new mouth Tuesday. \"A small notch was also recently made at the west end of the North Plug to allow for construction of the riverbank where it meets the wall. Some water and debris flowed into the new river here, and the water level was a little higher than usual,\" Waterfront Toronto said in its post. \"Otherwise, the storm did not impact the construction site and increased waters from the Don River were still moving by way of the Keating Channel.\" However the organization also noted that the project is not meant to protect all areas that were affected by Tuesday's flooding. \"The Port Lands Flood Protection project is designed to protect the Port Lands and portions of Leslieville and South Riverdale in a storm even bigger than yesterday's. It is not designed to mitigate flooding on the Don Valley Parkway, which remains within the Don River flood plain.\" Speaking with CP24 Tuesday, Environment Canada Senior Climatologist Dave Phillips said that while the city might typically see one or two thunderstorms with heavy rain in a month, Tuesday brought three in quick succession and the infrastructure was not designed to cope. \"So huge amounts of rain and the system, the city infrastructure, couldn't take it. It was overworked. He pointed out that Toronto is \"a different city\" than it was about 20 or 30 years ago, with far more concrete surfaces and less green space that could absorb heavy rainfall. Chow reiterated Wednesday that the city has been looking at ways to encourage people not to pave their properties over with nonporous surfaces. \"We want to do more. For big parking lots, if it's just concrete, the water basically just runs off,\" Chow said. \"What we want them to do is have interlocking bricks, so that the water can seep into the ground, rather than just run off and flood everything else.\" Earlier this year, staff proposed a separate tax be added to utility bills as a fixed charge, depending on the size of the paved area on a property.  The move led to cries that Toronto was trying to add a \"rain tax.\" Chow directed staff to take another look following an outcry, but said at the time that it was important to have a plan that supports more green infrastructure, prevents flooding, and keeps water bills low. \n",

            " Thursday, July 18, 2024 2:45PM EDT It appears that not even race car drivers are immune to Toronto gridlock. The Honda Indy held a press conference at the Exhibition Grounds on Thursday where some of the drivers who will compete in this weekend’s races spoke with reporters. But one of them almost didn’t make it. Lochie Hughes, an Australian driver who competes in the USF Pro 2000 series, told reporters that he nearly missed the event due to the traffic and had to eventually find another way to get to the track. “I am just super happy to be here in Toronto. I got stuck in traffic as well so I actually rented a bike to get here on time and then ran the rest of the way,” he said. “It is cool to just be outside along the water there. It reminds me a little bit of back home in Australia, people outdoors playing tennis.” The westbound lanes of Lake Shore Boulevard West are closed from Strachan Avenue to British Columbia Drive in order to accommodate the annual street race and police have previously warned drivers to expect “significant delays” in the area. Hughes might not have gotten that message but he was nonetheless in good spirits on Thursday as he spoke about his impressions of the city. “There are Smarties here. At our hotel we have Smarties so I feel right at home,” he said. Hughes isn’t the only visitor to Toronto who has had to alter their plans due to the city’s notorious gridloick. Last month former One Direction member Niall Horan made headlines after he posted a video which showed him walking to the Scotiabank Arena for a performance because the city’s traffic was “too bad.” In the video, which was sped up and had The Proclaimer’s “I’m Gonna Be (500 miles)” playing in the background, Horan was seen walking from just west of Yonge Street to an underground entrance of Scotiabank Arena past Bay Street. “In all the years I’ve been playing shows, I don’t think I’ve ever walked into a venue,” Horan said in the video. Hughes is scheduled to compete in two USF Pro 2000 series races this weekend. The main event, the NTT INDYCAR SERIES race, will wrap up a weekend of racing at 1:30 p.m. on Sunday. \n",

            " Thursday, July 18, 2024 11:39AM EDT Shoppers could soon see an expanded selection of alcoholic beverages at their local grocery store, as a strike by LCBO workers continues to drag on. The 450 grocery stores that are licensed to sell alcohol in Ontario are permitted to order ready-to-drink beverages and larger packs of beer as of today, meaning that the beverages could start showing up on some store shelves relatively soon. The province had previously set a date of August 1 to allow grocery stores to sell ready-to-drink cocktails but announced earlier this week that it was moving up the timeline. Ready-to-drink beverages have been at the forefront of the LCBO strike, with the Ontario Public Service Employees Union previously identifying it as a key issue for his members. Premier Doug Ford, for his part, has said that he is unwilling to budge when it comes to its government’s plans to allow grocers to sell ready-to-drink cocktails. “If they want to negotiate over RTD (Ready-To-Drink beverages), the deal is off,” Ford told reporters at a news conference in Etobicoke last week. “Let me be very clear. It is done, it is gone. That ship has sailed. It’s halfway across Lake Ontario.” LCBO outlets across Ontario have been shuttered since talks broke down and about 9.000 OPSEU members walked off the job on July 5. Talks between the union and the province resumed on Wednesday and are continuing today, OPSEU has told CTV News Toronto. Meanwhile, the province continues to move ahead with its plans to expand the sale of some alcoholic beverages. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance told CP24.com earlier this week that the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario has issued licenses to 3,153 convenience stores to sell beer, wine, cider and ready-to-drink beverages since applications first opened on June 17. An additional 54 grocery stores have also been issued licenses. “In less than two months, on September 5, the Ontario marketplace will hit a new milestone with all eligible convenience stores able to sell beer, cider, wine, and ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages. As the first segment of the market to be expanded, we are pleased that so many convenience stores are gearing up to provide people with more choice,” Colin Blachar said. “As the province implements its plan, the government will continue to constantly evaluate how it can deliver choice and convenience.” The Ontario government has previously indicated that the LCBO will retain the exclusive right to sell spirits in Ontario, even as it allows more retailers to sell other alcoholic beverages. \n",

            " Thursday, July 18, 2024 1:31PM EDT Police are warning the public after a large quantity of unapproved prescription drugs were seized during a recent raid in York Region. York Regional Police (YRP) launched an investigation into the trafficking of controlled substances in Vaughan in May. On July 11, police executed a search warrant at a home near Highway 7 and Woodstream Boulevard, east of Martin Grove Road. Police say that officers recovered an “abundance” of prescription drugs that have not been approved by regulatory authorities for “safety, efficacy and quality or for sale in Canada.” The drugs include anabolic steroids, hormone receptors, testosterone replacements, synthetic steroids, erectile dysfunction medications, and opiates. Police said they also seized a quantity of pills they believe to be MDMA as well as two fraudulently registered motor vehicles. Two Vaughan residents have been charged. Jamal Hassan, 29 and Ashley Cunningham, 34, are both facing drug-related charges. “York Regional Police is reminding the public that prescription drugs being sold on the illegal market are often imported from overseas and do not have the same stringent safety regulations as Health Canada,” police said in a news release. “No prescription drugs should be purchased from unlicensed sources, as they may not contain the product that is being advertised. This includes unknown ingredients, incorrect dosages and contamination. Consuming these products can lead to serious health consequences, including hospitalization or even death. Always use legitimate channels to obtain prescription medications safely.” Police continue to investigate and are asking anyone with information to contact investigators. \n",

            " Thursday, July 18, 2024 1:15PM EDT Toronto is still drying out after a storm dropped more than a month’s worth of rain on the city earlier this week, leaving some residents to deal with flooded basements and property damage left in its wake. “I was literally shocked,” Karma Kunsang, a resident of the Rockcliffe–Smythe neighbourhood in Toronto’s northwest, told CTV News Toronto. The area was particularly hit hard by Tuesday’s rainfall and the water levels in Kunsang’s basement reached knee-high height, destroying furniture and toppling over large appliances as the storm surged. “This place, it was like a movie. When this happens to your own house, your brain stops working,” he said. Toronto flooding: Pictures, videos show heavy rainfall in downtown core Eric Swanson lives nearby and saw at least a foot of water in his home’s lower level, despite installing a pressure-sealing door and powered backwater valve in the basement. “Do we call insurance? Do we not call insurance? The mould and the disgustingness of the water and all those issues…I need to get this properly cleaned and taken care of so that my house is still livable,” Swanson said. Homes weren’t the only things damaged in the record-breaking storm, which saw nearly 100 millimetres of rainfall in just a few hours. Several vehicles were also abandoned by their drivers after water gushed onto major roadways across the city, including the Don Valley Parkway where 14 people needed to be rescued. The torrential downpour is already being compared to Toronto’s 2013 storm – listed as one of the most expensive natural disasters in Canada, according to insurance payouts. Data from the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) shows that claims filed in the aftermath of that weather event reached $1 billion. While it’s too early to put a dollar figure on the damage left it the aftermath of Tuesday’s storm, the IBC told CTV News Toronto that the two events are “similar.” “We can’t determine, at this point, what the magnitude of this event is,” Anne Marie Thomas, IBC’s director of consumer and industry relations, said. “We can’t say what this event will cost because, as you can imagine, not everyone has filed an insurance claim yet.” Insurance tips for flooded house, car If your basement was flooded or you needed to abandon your vehicle, the first thing you should do is reach out to you insurer or insurance broker to check your coverage. “Not all [insurance] policies have coverage for weather events like this one,” Thomas said, adding that sewer backup coverage and overland flood coverage would be needed in the case of home insurance, both of which are optional and not always included in basic policies. “A typical homeowner's insurance policy doesn't cover damage caused by sewer backup or flood. It only covers [damage] caused by a burst pipe or something like that in your home,” she said. After you’ve determined what type of coverage you have, the next step is making an inventory of all the damaged items, including taking pictures and videos of those items. If you have proof of purchase, such as a receipt, for an item you’re looking to make a claim for, that will assist in the process. One important note is to hold on to any damaged items before you dispose of them, because, as Thomas explains, the insurance adjuster will want to see the damage as it was at the time of the event. “So if your house is damaged, and you go, ‘OK, I'm just gonna get rid of this.’ Wait until your insurance company says it's okay. Unless that item is posing a health hazard or is a danger,” she said. READ MORE: What to know about insurance claims after Tuesday's flash flooding in Ontario As well, if you rented any equipment to dry out your home, such as a shop vac or industrial fan, keep those receipts as you could be reimbursed. In terms of vehicle insurance for owners who were forced to ditch their vehicle amid the flooding, much like home insurance, only certain policies will cover the damage. “In order for those vehicles to be covered by insurance, the owner of the vehicle would have to have purchased collision or comprehensive coverage or ‘all perils’ coverage,” Thomas said. “Those are the optional physical damage coverages that you can buy for your car. If you have that, then your insurance company would pay to either fix the vehicle or write off your vehicle.” Typically, following a storm like the one on Tuesday, Thomas said the full “realization” of the damage isn’t known until 30 to 45 days after the event. \n",

The area was particularly hit hard by Tuesday’s rainfall and the water levels in Kunsang’s basement reached knee-high height, destroying furniture and toppling over large appliances as the storm surged. “I was literally shocked,” he said.

Kunsang’s basement reached knee-high height, destroying furniture and toppling over large appliances as the storm surged. “This place, it was like a movie. When this happens to your own house, your brain stops working,” he said. Toronto flooding: Pictures, videos show heavy rainfall in downtown core Eric Swanson lives nearby and saw at least a foot of water in his home’s lower level, despite installing a pressure-sealing door and powered backwater valve in the basement. “Do we call insurance? Do we not call insurance? The mould and the disgustingness of the water and all those issues…I need to get this properly cleaned and taken care of so that my house is still livable,” Swanson said. Homes weren’t the only things damaged in the record-breaking storm, which saw nearly 100 millimetres of rainfall in just a few hours. Several vehicles were also abandoned by their drivers after water gushed onto major roadways across the city, including the Don Valley Parkway where 14 people needed to be rescued. The torrential downpour is already being compared to Toronto’s 2013 storm – listed as one of the most expensive natural disasters in Canada, according to insurance payouts.

While it’s too early to put a dollar figure on the damage left it the aftermath of Tuesday’s storm, the IBC told CTV News Toronto that the two events are “similar.” “We can’t determine, at this point, what the magnitude of this event is,” Anne Marie Thomas, IBC’s director of consumer and industry relations, said. “We can’t say what this event will cost because, as you can imagine, not everyone has filed an insurance claim yet.” Insurance tips for flooded house, car If your basement was flooded or you needed to abandon your vehicle, the first thing you should do is reach out to you insurer or insurance broker to check your coverage. “Not all [insurance] policies have coverage for weather events like this one,” Thomas said, adding that sewer backup coverage and overland flood coverage would be needed in the case of home insurance, both of which are optional and not always included in basic policies. “A typical homeowner's insurance policy doesn't cover damage caused by sewer backup or flood. It only covers [damage] caused by a burst pipe or something like that in your home,” she said.

The Toronto Police Service (TPS) said it first received reports that two vehicles had been damaged by falling objects in the area of Pottery Road and Broadview Avenue in March. Officers determined that the vehicles had been damaged by “various sizes of metal BBs and glass marbles,” police said in a release issued Thursday. Police said they do not know where the objects originated from or who may be responsible. Police said they received a third report in July of a vehicle in the same area damaged by falling objects. In that incident, they said an unknown person threw glass, ball bearings and marbles onto vehicles on Pottery Road. “Drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists in the area are urged to use caution and to be vigilant as police continue to investigate,” the release states.

            " Thursday, July 18, 2024 1:54PM EDT A massive summer storm which brought flooding to Toronto earlier this week also dealt a blow to one of the city's major food banks. The North York Harvest Food Bank says it suffered around $50,000 in lost food and damage from the flooding, hampering its ability to provide to those in need. Natasha Bowes, director of development and marketing for the food bank, told CP24 Thursday that the rain overwhelmed their systems. \"It ended up backing up onto our loading docks. We were trying to rescue the food. The power went out,\" she said. The organization tried to transport some of the food to a cold storage facility, but much of it was lost. \"Then while we were trying to save the food that we had in the fridges, we ended up damaging one of our trucks. There was some water damage. So just things built, one over another. Our freezer is already broken. So we're really calling out for the community to help us right now.\" The food bank issued an urgent appeal after the damage. \"Our loading bays are flooded, our freezer is broken, and water is pouring into our warehouse,\" the group said on its website. \"The power outage caused us to lose a significant amount of refrigerated food, including milk, cheese, meat, and nutritious kids snacks intended to nourish our community.\" They are calling for cash donations to help with the recovery, as well as canned goods. \"They can drop it off at their local fire stations. We have donation boxes at grocery stores across North York, and also here at 116 Industry Street,\" Bowes said. She pointed out that the food bank has seen a high level of usage in the community recently, so the timing is difficult. \"The cost of food, inflation, rent in Toronto is just absolutely insane – so the amount of people that are coming, it was a record month for us,\" Bowes said. \"We've never seen this many people come through the doors and it just keeps going up and up.\" \n",

            " Thursday, July 18, 2024 12:32PM EDT New condominium sales plummeted to a 27-year-low during the first six months of 2024 as a “sharp downturn in construction starts” in Toronto continued to impact inventory levels, a new report by a real estate research group suggests. Urbanation Inc. says that just 3,159 new condo units were sold in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area during the first half of the year, representing a 57 per cent decline from the same time period one year prior and a 72 per cent drop as compared to the 10-year average. Urbanation says that it was also the slowest first half for new condo sales since 1997. “With condo prices still near record highs and only a modest 25 basis point decline in interest rates in June from their 22-year high, buyers remained cautious in anticipation of further rate cuts and amidst a burgeoning supply of units for sale,” Urbanation President Shaun Hildebrand said in a news release. “The continued weakening in condo market conditions during the second quarter of 2024 is likely to cause more projects that were slated to launch this year to remain on hold, while others that are struggling to meet sales thresholds for construction financing may ultimately be pulled from the market.” Urbanation says that the total number of unsold condo units in the GTHA has now reached a record high of 25,89, which equates to about 34 months of supply. That is approximately 10,000 more units than the long-term average, the group points out. However, despite the surplus prices have remained relatively stable. Urbanation says that the average asking price for unsold units declined just 2.6 per cent over the past year and by only 4.5 per cent over the past two years. “This demonstrates how sticky new condominium prices have become due to high development and financing costs, and record prices paid for land at the market peak,” the release notes. The GTA’s real estate market has faced significant headwinds over the last two years due to a significant increase in the price of borrowing. In June the average selling price of a home in the Greater Toronto Area across all property types was $1,162,167. That is down from a peak of $1,334,062 in February 2022, which was the prior to the Bank of Canada beginning its interest rate hiking cycle. \n",

            " Thursday, July 18, 2024 8:46AM EDT A Toronto rapper's firearm charges have been dropped after a judge found police breached his Charter rights and gave “tailored” testimonies while on the stand. In an Ontario Superior Court decision released last month, Justice Sandra Nishikawa handed Omary Bent, 27, a stay of proceedings. He was acquitted of four firearm charges laid on him in the summer of 2021. The acquittal was granted, in part, after Nishikawa found that the officers used excessive force in dragging Bent out of his Etobicoke condominium by his hair and breached his right to counsel in questioning him without a lawyer present. In turn, the judge found the court should “distance itself” from the evidence obtained during the raid. Download our app to get alerts on your device Get the latest local updates right to your inbox According to court documents, the Toronto Police Service (TPS) began looking into Bent after it was suggested by a confidential source that he’d been dealing drugs and possessed a firearm. Police raided Brent’s home on July 27, 2021, deploying a Taser on him within minutes. According to Bent, he was hit with the energy weapon while his hands were in the air. One of the officers involved, however, said the Taser had been deployed as Bent reached for a satchel that was later found with a loaded pistol inside. Another officer told the court that the Taser had been deployed as Bent walked towards the police with his hand in his pocket. After being Tased, Bent was then dragged shirtless from his home by his hair, the judge found. Bent testified that the officer dragging him said, “I should have f*****g killed you,” before leaving him with another officer in the building’s stairwell. A photograph taken of Bent by his sister, later used as evidence, shows a bald, raw spot where one of his braids had detached from the skin of his scalp. Bent testified that police then asked for access to his vehicle before giving him the chance to speak with a lawyer, at one point threatening to break the windows if he didn’t comply. Police, meanwhile, have insisted that Brent told officers where they could find the keys without coercion. Nothing was found during a police search of the vehicle. Bent did, however, did admit that he threw a guitar case from his 37th floor balcony. Court documents say that a gun was later found inside that case. Police ultimately charged Bent with one count each of possession of a loaded prohibited firearm and possession of a non-restricted firearm without a licence, along with two counts of possession of a prohibited device, namely an over-capacity magazine. 'False and misleading' In examining the testimonies given by the officers on what led them to Taser Bent, the judge found one of the officer’s accounts “impossible to accept.” She ruled that his testimony that Brent had reached for a satchel contradicted not only the accounts of other officers present but his own. In a report made prior to giving his testimony, the officer had stated Bent had dropped his hands and made no mention of a satchel. In that report, the officer had checked ‘yes’ under ‘Subject Confirmed Armed.’ Bent was not found to be armed. “In this case, checking “yes” [...] was false and misleading,” the judge wrote in her decision. “In my view, [the officer] completed the CEW Report in a manner that would avoid questioning of his use of a Taser.” The judge also took issue with the testimony of three other officers who said they did not recall if Bent had been shirtless at the time of the raid or not. The judge found their accounts inaccurate and described them as an effort to suggest Bent may have had a hidden weapon. “In my view, the officers’ subsequent attempt to justify the use of force by different after-the-fact explanations belies any good faith belief in the necessity of using force at the time,” she wrote. Ultimately, Nishikawa ruled that the deployment of the Taser constituted an excessive use of force and in turn, violated Bent’s Charter rights. The request made by officers for Bent to hand over his keys before speaking to a lawyer was also deemed a breach of rights. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for the Toronto Police Service said that an adverse comment made by a judge cannot be taken as a definitive ruling on officer conduct. “It is important to understand that negative judicial comments do not necessarily constitute misconduct,” Stephanie Sayer wrote in an email to CTV News Toronto. “When officers are testifying in court, they are not the ones on trial. Like any witness, the officers are not parties to the proceeding – they have no right to representation, no ability to call witnesses or make submissions, no right to make legal arguments, etc. They are there to answer the questions posed to them.” In this case, Sayer said the Crown had reviewed the officers’ testimony and found no evidence of misconduct. Still, she said the service’s Professional Standards Unit was investigating the allegations. Case does damage to trust in policing: Lawyer Bent’s lawyers, Hilary Dudding and Maxime Bédard, told CTV News Toronto that the case serves as an important lesson in public trust in policing. “It's so important that the public feel confident in the police and feel that the police are going to be enforcing laws fairly and within the boundary of the law themselves,” Dudding said. “Even one case like this does damage to the trust that the community has in the police service.” “Police are like every other group of people,” she continued. “There's always going to be frailty there, but looking at a system that takes this more seriously and provides some accountability to the public when this happens is really, really important.” Dudding added that it shouldn’t be left up to individuals to face off against the authorities in court, and put forth the idea of a public oversight body tasked with reviewing these kinds of claims more strenuously. “When an internal process takes place, one wonders how many of these complaints are reviewed or how seriously they're taken, and what the consequences are,” she continued. “We’d all benefit from a more strenuous approach to these things, because we need to focus on the issues that really matter in court, as opposed to trying to figure out what really happened during an engagement with the police.” In unrelated proceedings, Bent is facing a charge of second-degree murder in connection with the stabbing of 24-year-old Shacquan Harrison . He is scheduled to stand trial in late 2024 or early 2025. \n",

Halton police say that investigators with its organized crime unit began an investigation on July 11 after identifying a recently stolen vehicle from Peel Region at a rural address in Milton. Police say that officers subsequently executed a search warrant at the property and arrested three individuals at the scene. Police say that 12 stolen vehicles “in various stages of being disassembled” were also recovered.

Police say that Khan had also been subject to a prior release order at the time of his arrest for similar offences. All three suspects have since been released on bail and are due back in court on Aug. 26. Police continue to investigate and are asking anyone with information to contact investigators. \n",

            " Thursday, July 18, 2024 3:51PM EDT As floodwaters poured into a Mississauga long-term care home –submerging much of the ground floor – rescue crews worked to rapidly get residents into inflatable rafts to evacuate the property while others worked on stopping the water from rising further. The operation that unfolded over the course of 12 hours on Tuesday following torrential rains eventually saw more than 100 residents safely moved out of the nursing home, some by raft and others on foot once the water receded. Mississauga Fire Captain Dan Herd said the evacuation of the Tyndall Seniors Village, which saw multiple emergency services from across the Greater Toronto Area come together, was on a scale he hadn't seen before. \"There was water inside the building, the first floor – in between probably three to four feet high on the walls – and some windows were broken, damaged,” Herd said, adding that the parking lot was inundated by water at one point. \"We set up an instant action plan, and we started to move thousands of litres of water at a time ... the water rescue team was using their rescue boats to assist the removal of ambulatory patients and occupants.\" The flooding began after incredibly heavy rains on Tuesday caused the nearby Etobicoke Creek to overflow, Herd said. Once enough floodwater had been pumped out of the home, some residents were able to walk out of the building, he said. Those who were unable to walk were carried down stairs and out of the building by first responders using lifting equipment, Herd said. \"This is my first personal experience of something to this size,” he said of the operation. None of the residents were injured, said Tom Kukolic, acting deputy chief for Peel Region's paramedics service. Once first responders determined that none of the 116 residents needed emergency care, efforts then shifted to a \"safe extrication and relocation\" operation, Kukolic said, with residents eventually taken to two long-term care homes and two hotels. \"Once the paramedics and firefighters were able to bring the residents out of the home and move them to the triage area, we then had assistance from Peel Wheel-Trans, Toronto TTC Wheel-Trans, and Mississauga Transit,” Kukolic said. The relocation effort was “a seamless transition” thanks to the collaboration of several emergency response teams, including York Region and Toronto paramedics, he said. “Extricating people, it’s very difficult. It is very laborious work ... however, what we do from a paramedic practice perspective, is ensure that we have enough people to safely move residents,\" Kukolic said. Tuesday's massive downpour caused chaos across Toronto and its surrounding communities, with flooding shutting down several major routes and terminals and knocking out power to thousands. Mississauga Fire Chief Deryn Rizzi called the response at the nursing home “a great example” of how multiple agencies across the Greater Toronto Area can work together. \"We are there to work collaboratively together, to address the incident to achieve a common goal, which in this case, it was to evacuate the residents safely,\" he said. For Kukolic, the full-day operation showed how preparation can help first responders deal with large-scale responses triggered by sudden events such as Tuesday's flooding. \"I was proud to be a member of paramedic services and a first responder,” he said. \"It was really great to see how everybody came together to ensure that our most vulnerable were taken care of.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 18, 2024. \n",

            " Wednesday, July 17, 2024 5:06PM EDT The city dumped more than 1,300 megalitres of partially treated wastewater into Lake Ontario during Tuesday’s torrential downpour , which is enough to fill 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools. A city spokesperson said three wastewater plants were “ bypassing ,” a process in which stormwater and sewage are diverted from a secondary treatment procedure. IN PHOTOS: A look back at the massive flooding across Toronto “The bypassed wastewater still goes through screening, grit removal, primary treatment, phosphorous removal and full disinfection to ensure the treated water always meets strict federal and provincial regulations,” the spokesperson said, adding that the process is done to protect the plants’ ability to continue treating wastewater during an extreme rainstorm. Health officials have advised against swimming in Lake Ontario for 48 hours after rainfall due to the possible presence of high levels of bacteria. On Wednesday, all of Toronto’s beaches were under a red flag. The 10 beaches were marked unsafe for swimming due to high levels of E.coli in the water. “Much of the sewage that may have been deposited after the storm should be disinfected through exposure to UV through the sunlight. It can be unsafe to swim, even at designated swimming beaches, for up to 48 hours after a major rainfall,” the city said. “Storms increase bacteria in the lake, and 48 hours is long enough for bacteria levels in the lake water to drop or dissipate to ensure that the beach water is again safe enough for swimming.” On Tuesday, thunderstorms brought heavy rainfall within three hours, causing widespread flooding across the city. According to Environment Canada, 97.6 millimetres of rain fell, which is more than a month’s worth of precipitation . In July, Toronto usually receives around 75 millimetres of rain. \n",

            " Thursday, July 18, 2024 6:06AM EDT Former public safety minister Marco Mendicino is calling for the creation of \"protective zones\" around political constituency offices to shield members of Parliament and their staff from a rising tide of threatening behaviour. Mendicino, a Toronto Liberal MP, said under the plan anyone who intimidated or otherwise harassed people within the buffer zone of perhaps 50 to 100 metres would be subject to harsher criminal penalties including jail time. In an interview, Mendicino suggested spelling out such zones in regulations that will flow from the recently passed foreign interference bill, which contains new measures to protect essential infrastructure. The former minister's comments come as the attempted assassination of ex-U.S. president Donald Trump prompts renewed concern and discussion about the safety of Canadian politicians. \"We have to take parliamentary security more seriously,\" Mendicino said. \"We need as Canadians to open our eyes and recognize that political violence is not something that just occurs somewhere else, but that it is happening here in our own communities.\" People have constitutional rights to express a point of view and disagree with fellow Canadians including parliamentarians, he said. \"But it's also true that we're seeing more threats, more intimidation, more harassment, which can lead to harm both online and in the community.\" In the last few years, several MPs from different parties have had their constituency offices targeted, including graffiti spray-painted on the exterior and rocks thrown through windows. Mendicino says he has received \"a barrage of death threats\" and that his family has also been targeted. A man recently spat on the MP in Ottawa as he walked to his office. He and his constituency staff have become more prudent about booking appointments with members of the public, devoting more effort to vetting and screening. Housing Minister Sean Fraser says he, too, has received death threats. \"My home has been outfitted with a greater degree of security than I feel is ordinary or that I'm personally even comfortable with,\" he said in an interview. \"But when security officials tell you they need to make certain decisions in your best interest when it comes to personal safety and security, you listen to them.\" Police have provided more protection to federal politicians from various parties in recent years. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said this week he worries about his family's safety, and that he had sought protection in response to menacing behaviour. Mendicino, who was minister responsible for the national police force from October 2021 to July last year, said he \"always found that the RCMP were prepared to step up.\" \"But it's my view that they continue to need more resources, that local law enforcement needs more resources, and that we should leave all options on the table when it comes to creating new authorities for them\" to help prevent harassment, he added. RCMP commissioner Mike Duheme recently said he wanted the government to look at drafting a new law that would make it easier for police to pursue charges against people who threaten elected officials. However, Justice Minister Arif Virani subsequently suggested existing Criminal Code provisions were sufficient. Mendicino said the government needs to press social media companies to do more to ensure online spaces are free of invective and harassment. He also acknowledges \"politicians need to look in the mirror themselves.\" \"And I don't think it's particularly helpful to point fingers and say one party is more guilty of of engaging in extreme rhetoric than the other. I think we've got a collective responsibility to raise the bar of political debate,\" he said. Overall, he worries \"that the trends are all moving in the wrong direction.\" Unless the problem is taken seriously, it will spur more political violence and make it harder to attract and retain good people in politics, Mendicino added. \"I'm going to continue to speak out on this issue to prevent that from happening.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 18, 2024. — With a file from Alessia Passafiume \n",

            " Wednesday, July 17, 2024 5:27PM EDT A massive rainstorm which flooded roads, basements and businesses in the city Tuesday is raising questions about Toronto's preparedness when it comes to major weather events. The storm, which dumped a month's worth of rain on the city in a matter of hours, overwhelmed sewer systems and waterways, causing damage and hampering transit. While such storms are rare, they are not unheard of. Another storm about a decade ago in 2013 caused major flooding, submerging vehicles and necessitating the rescue of passengers from a half-submerged GO Train. With more adverse weather expected due to climate change, the city has undertaken flood mitigation work over the past decade, including a massive project to reroute the mouth of the Don River to add flood protection in the Port Lands – a project which marked a major milestone just last week and which is expected to be compete by the end of this year. But the fact that the city has undertaken flood protection work over the past few years left some wondering why the city was then so overwhelmed by Tuesday's storm. Speaking on CTV Your Morning Wednesday, Mayor Olivia Chow said flood mitigation is at various stages of work in areas across the city, with some projects still waiting for dollars to flow. \"The west area, still some of those homeowners can't even get insurance for their basements because they've been flooding so much,\" Chow said. \"So we're waiting for the federal government to join us to really do flood mitigation measures in the west end of the city. It's about $300 million, and they've said yes, it's just we're waiting for the funds to flow.\" Chow said the city also has \"very, very aggressive\" plans to build more housing in the East Harbour area, east of the Don River, but is also waiting on about $200 million from the federal government for flood protection. However she did note that Ottawa has contributed in a \"big\" way to flood protection with the project to naturalize the mouth of the Don River. One of the massive concrete \"plugs\" separating the newly-created stretch of river was removed last week. Once all of the plugs have been removed, the river will flow out through the new mouth, instead of emptying into the narrow Keating Channel. \"The last plug about to be pulled out in the next couple of months, that will allow the Don River to flow into Lake Ontario, and that would ease a lot of the flooding,\" Chow said. \"So it's happening, but we're almost there.\" In a post, Waterfront Toronto confirmed that while a small amount of water from the Don River entered the new stretch of river, the project was not at a stage of completion that would have allowed water to flow through to the new mouth Tuesday. \"A small notch was also recently made at the west end of the North Plug to allow for construction of the riverbank where it meets the wall. Some water and debris flowed into the new river here, and the water level was a little higher than usual,\" Waterfront Toronto said in its post. \"Otherwise, the storm did not impact the construction site and increased waters from the Don River were still moving by way of the Keating Channel.\" However the organization also noted that the project is not meant to protect all areas that were affected by Tuesday's flooding. \"The Port Lands Flood Protection project is designed to protect the Port Lands and portions of Leslieville and South Riverdale in a storm even bigger than yesterday's. It is not designed to mitigate flooding on the Don Valley Parkway, which remains within the Don River flood plain.\" Speaking with CP24 Tuesday, Environment Canada Senior Climatologist Dave Phillips said that while the city might typically see one or two thunderstorms with heavy rain in a month, Tuesday brought three in quick succession and the infrastructure was not designed to cope. \"So huge amounts of rain and the system, the city infrastructure, couldn't take it. It was overworked. He pointed out that Toronto is \"a different city\" than it was about 20 or 30 years ago, with far more concrete surfaces and less green space that could absorb heavy rainfall. Chow reiterated Wednesday that the city has been looking at ways to encourage people not to pave their properties over with nonporous surfaces. \"We want to do more. For big parking lots, if it's just concrete, the water basically just runs off,\" Chow said. \"What we want them to do is have interlocking bricks, so that the water can seep into the ground, rather than just run off and flood everything else.\" Earlier this year, staff proposed a separate tax be added to utility bills as a fixed charge, depending on the size of the paved area on a property.  The move led to cries that Toronto was trying to add a \"rain tax.\" Chow directed staff to take another look following an outcry, but said at the time that it was important to have a plan that supports more green infrastructure, prevents flooding, and keeps water bills low. \n",

            " Thursday, July 18, 2024 5:57AM EDT Any Ontario strategy to end intimate partner violence must include more programs for men at risk of becoming perpetrators, an area in which the province is currently sorely lacking, experts told a committee Wednesday. There is a \"smattering\" of services available, said Katreena Scott, academic director of the Centre for Research and Education on Violence Against Women and Children at Western University, but it is too few and far between. \"The reality in Ontario is that we live, right now, in a system where if there is somebody who is engaging in — or is at risk for — hurtful, abusive or coercive behaviour, it's very, very difficult to find and get help,\" Scott told a legislative committee studying intimate partner violence. \"Really, what has to happen is they need to wait until they're involved in the criminal justice system.\" The Progressive Conservative government said this spring that it would support an NDP bill to declare intimate partner violence an epidemic, but then-government house leader Paul Calandra also tasked the justice committee with a broader study of the issue. Those hearings began Wednesday. The move came nearly a year after the province rejected calls from an inquest into the deaths of three women at the hands of their former partner to make the declaration, saying it couldn't label intimate partner violence an epidemic because it was not an infectious or communicable disease. The jury at a coroner’s inquest into the 2015 deaths of Nathalie Warmerdam, Carol Culleton and Anastasia Kuzyk in Renfrew County made 86 recommendations aimed at preventing similar tragedies. One of those recommendations was to establish a 24-hour hotline for men who need support to prevent them from engaging in such violence, but the government has not yet acted on it. Experts at the legislative committee Wednesday held up an Alberta program as a good example of support for prevention, which offers men counselling, a 24-hour telephone support line, online resources and toolkits. Lana Wells, an associate professor at the University of Calgary and a domestic violence researcher, said men are predominantly the perpetrators of intimate partner violence and a provincial strategy to end it must include supports for them. \"When men and boys can emotionally self-regulate, embody gender-equitable norms and behaviours, have the skills to disrupt sexism, violence within themselves and their peers, embrace non-violence, have the skills to heal, repair and manage conflict, be accountable, and actively inspire their peers, colleagues and children to do the same, then we can stop violence before it starts,\" she told the committee. \"So what can Ontario do to advance this area? I think really focusing on removing the burden from victims and victimology and start to focus our attention on the people and systems that are causing harm.\" Better data is also needed that can speak to prevention, Wells said, as most of the research in this area has focused on victims. There needs to be more information on any patterns that precede domestic violence and what factors can lead people to become perpetrators in order to disrupt those trajectories, she said. The Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services said it spent more than $350 million in the last fiscal year on services to address and prevent gender-based violence, including more than $10 million in violence-prevention initiatives. \"Everyone has the right to live free from fear, exploitation, intimidation, and the threat of violence,\" the ministry wrote in a statement. \"That is why our government is working to prevent intimate partner violence before it occurs.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 17, 2024. \n",

            " Thursday, July 18, 2024 4:08PM EDT Gen. Jennie Carignan was a little emotional on Thursday as she spoke to reporters about what it means to take over command of the Canadian Armed Forces. It's an honour that felt like the natural next step in her career, she said, something she's worked toward for the last 38 years. It also means, for other women or marginalized people, that \"it's possible, folks — the door is open.\" \"This is actually what my parents used to tell me: 'Anything is possible. You can do anything,'\" she said. \"But I realized in 1986 that that was not necessarily true for everybody. Even if the doors were open, perceptions stay. There's unconscious biases that, frankly, I do have to question, myself, regularly.\" Carignan became chief of the defence staff in a ceremony at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa on Thursday morning, taking over from Gen. Wayne Eyre, who is set to retire after three years in the job. \"I feel ready, poised and supported to take on this manifold challenge,\" Carignan said at the ceremony, with dignitaries including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Gov. Gen. Mary Simon looking on. \"So I embark on my tenure as your chief of defence staff with confidence. Confidence in our team, in our partners and in Canadians. We've got this,\" she said. There are some big challenges ahead for the Armed Forces and its new leader. Carignan said her first priority is recruiting more Canadians to join the military, and keeping existing troops in uniform. There are more than 16,000 vacant positions in the military, with shortfalls throughout its various ranks and professions. At the same time, more than 70,000 people applied to join the Armed Forces in the last year — but just over 4,300 actually got in. The government's defence policy says modernized recruitment processes are aimed at rebuilding the military by 2032. Carignan said she will start gathering her team to figure out how to make that happen faster. \"Recruiting personnel is a complex affair,\" she said. \"If we can get the momentum and get more people in, then sometimes it has a contagious effect.\" For the last three years, Carignan led the office of professional conduct and culture, which was created as a result of the sexual misconduct scandal in 2021. Culture change is still \"at the heart of everything we do,\" she said, adding that in 2021, her office set a course to create \"irreversible change\" over five years. Carignan said she believes the military is still well on track to meet that target. \"We will always deal with misconduct, but it's how we navigate,\" she said. There is another five-year timeline she's thinking about, too. Carignan told reporters that based on talks with allies, she believes Canada has about five years to get ready to face a new set of threats — conventional military threats from adversaries like China, Russia and Iran, as well as emerging threats like disinformation. \"I think Canadians need to understand that if we are not ready, we might not be able to react appropriately in defence of them,\" she said. Defence Minister Bill Blair said his government feels a sense of urgency to get the Armed Forces the equipment it needs. His department has pledged to overhaul the notoriously slow and bureaucratic procurement system. \"We have to be ready to meet the moment,\" he said, cautioning that building new ships and planes is not a quick process. In his comments at the ceremony Eyre spoke about \"what could be existential threats,\" and said Canada has a history of being unprepared at the outset of wars. \"The security situation out there is not getting any better and we will continue to face many crises, often stacked one upon the other,\" he said. \"To do our part in the free world, we need to be at our own peak capability and readiness, and thus peak deterrence, to meet that threat.\" Carignan brings \"highly relevant experience\" to her role, Eyre said. He told her in French: \"You are ready for this role, and you deserve it.\" She was the first woman to command a combat unit in the Canadian military, and her career has included deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Syria. Following the formal handover of power, Trudeau thanked Eyre, saying he was \"the exact right person to help lead Canada through incredibly difficult times.\" He praised Carignan as someone of the right calibre to take over, and pointed out she is the first woman to lead the military of any G20 country. \"You've demonstrated time and time again the ability to lead with both strength and flexibility,\" Trudeau said. \"You've shown a tremendous sense of agility, vision and courage.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 18, 2024. — With files from Alessia Passafiume. \n",

            " Thursday, July 18, 2024 6:28AM EDT Republicans criticized U.S. President Joe Biden's record on foreign policy at the national convention in Milwaukee, as many party faithful called for America to step back from its contributions to the world. Wednesday's agenda and its theme of \"Make America Strong Once Again\" will give leaders around the world insight into the potential impact of a second Donald Trump presidency. \"No NATO. I want America strong,\" said Kimberly Nguyen, wearing a star-spangled dress and draped in a Trump 2024 flag outside the convention. Trump, who was officially confirmed as the Republican presidential candidate on Monday, has mused about increased tariffs, been critical of aid to Ukraine and repeatedly claimed he would not defend NATO members that don't meet defence spending targets, of which Canada is one. During a NATO leaders' summit in Washington last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to meet the spending target, which is the equivalent of two per cent of gross domestic product, by 2032. However, he has been criticized for the lengthy timeline and the lack of detail on how Ottawa will make it happen. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who is riding high in the polls, would not commit to the alliance's spending target, saying he doesn't make promises he can't keep. Trudeau faced a push from provincial leaders to speed up the spending timeline during a premiers' meeting in Halifax earlier Wednesday. Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew expressed concerns that failing to meet the target could jeopardize Canada's trading relationship with the U.S., particularly if there is a change in administration. Outside the Republican convention, there was little empathy for Canada's defence spending delay. Trump supporter Amy Lee said she supports the defensive alliance, but members must meet their commitments. \"Trudeau, we need you to pay your fair share to NATO,\" Lee said. All member countries directly contribute to the alliance's operations at an agreed-upon formula, and Canada pays its required share of that. Canada is one of about a dozen members that are not reaching the two per cent of GDP threshold for defence spending, though only seven members, including the U.S., spend more than Canada in real dollars. Top diplomats from around the world are at the convention to make inroads ahead of a possible second Trump presidency and to push Republicans away from some pledges the former president has made about defence alliances and trade. Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., said some Republicans have an isolationist bent. Many others, she said, understand that “America cannot be strong without having strong alliances.” “There is no singular voice on foreign policy as it relates to a number of issues at this point in the Republican Party,\" Hillman said in Milwaukee. Trump isn't officially scheduled to speak at the convention until Thursday, but has appeared each night of the convention, his right ear covered in a white bandage after it was pierced by a bullet when a man with an assault weapon fired from a rooftop near a rally Saturday afternoon. A rally attendee was killed and two others critically injured, before the gunman was shot dead by a member of the Secret Service. Wednesday was the first opportunity for Trump's running mate JD Vance to introduce himself to the world and he used his time to praise the former president, criticize Biden's foreign policy and highlight how disagreements can make the Republican party stronger. \"We will make sure our allies share in the burden of securing world peace. No more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Vance said. The 39-year-old Ohio senator has built a reputation during his short time in politics for fighting against current U.S. foreign policy and aid to Ukraine. Vance argued against further funding to the war-ravaged country in a column for the New York Times in April, and told the Munich Security Conference earlier this year that he was there to deliver a \"wake-up call\" that America's interests must come first. Trudeau has been one of the most outspoken NATO leaders in support of Ukraine, including at last week's leaders' summit. Vans with screens on the side were driving around the entrances of the convention Wednesday, displaying calls for Republicans to stand with Ukraine. The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, which funded the mobile messaging, said that was intended to remind Republicans that standing with Ukraine helps to defeat America's enemies. Hillman said Vance has some views on international and domestic policy that do not align with \"Canadian values in some circumstances and certainly our government policy in others.\" But, she said, Vance represents Ohio, which has a massive trading relationship with Canada. More than a third of the state's exports go to Canada. “Having someone with that understanding of the importance of the Canada-U.S. economic relationship is a good thing for Canada.” The vice president pick also has a Canadian connection: Jamil Jivani, the recently elected Conservative MP for Durham, has called Vance his best friend from Yale.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who is riding high in the polls, would not commit to the alliance's spending target, saying he doesn't make promises he can't keep. Trudeau faced a push from provincial leaders to speed up the spending timeline during a premiers' meeting in Halifax earlier Wednesday. Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew expressed concerns that failing to meet the target could jeopardize Canada's trading relationship with the U.S., particularly if there is a change in administration. Outside the Republican convention, there was little empathy for Canada's defence spending delay. Trump supporter Amy Lee said she supports the defensive alliance, but members must meet their commitments. Trump supporter Amy Lee said she supports the defensive alliance, but members must meet their commitments. \"Trudeau, we need you to pay your fair share to NATO,\" Lee said. All member countries directly contribute to the alliance's operations at an agreed-upon formula, and Canada pays its required share of that. Canada is one of about a dozen members that are not reaching the two per cent of GDP threshold for defence spending, though only seven members, including the U.S., spend more than Canada in real dollars. Top diplomats from around the world are at the convention to make inroads ahead of a possible second Trump presidency and to push Republicans away from some pledges the former president has made about defence alliances and trade. Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., said some Republicans have an isolationist bent. Many others, she said, understand that “America cannot be strong without having strong alliances.” “There is no singular voice on foreign policy as it relates to a number of issues at this point in the Republican Party,\" Hillman said in Milwaukee. Trump isn't officially scheduled to speak at the convention until Thursday, but has appeared each night of the convention, his right ear covered in a white bandage after it was pierced by a bullet when a man with an assault weapon fired from a rooftop near a rally Saturday afternoon. A rally attendee was killed and two others critically injured, before the gunman was shot dead by a member of the Secret Service. Wednesday was the first opportunity for Trump's running mate JD Vance to introduce himself to the world and he used his time to praise the former president, criticize Biden's foreign policy and highlight how disagreements can make the Republican party stronger. \"We will make sure our allies share in the burden of securing world peace. No more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Vance said. The 39-year-old Ohio senator has built a reputation during his short time in politics for fighting against current U.S. foreign policy and aid to Ukraine. Vance argued against further funding to the war-ravaged country in a column for the New York Times in April, and told the Munich Security Conference earlier this year that he was there to deliver a \"wake-up call\" that America's interests must come first. Trudeau has been one of the most outspoken NATO leaders in support of Ukraine, including at last week's leaders' summit. Vans with screens on the side of the podium\n",

            " Wednesday, July 17, 2024 8:49PM EDT Nineteen people believed to be part of a \"well-organized group\" allegedly distributing narcotics in Hamilton and Niagara Region have been arrested and charged, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. In a news release on Wednesday , the RCMP announced the result of its investigation into the group, which began in 2023 when they uncovered evidence of \"sophisticated drug networking\" in the Golden Horseshoe. Since April 2024, the RCMP said they have executed several warrants in three rounds, resulting in arrests and seizure of large quantities of crystal methamphetamine, cocaine, fentanyl, and prescription pills. In addition, multiple firearms, ammunition, ballistic vests, Canadian currency and other items allegedly used to help in the trafficking operation were also seized, the RCMP said. \"On top of that, several kilograms of suspicious substances have been sent to the lab to be tested for suspected narcotics,\" Mounties added. Among the 19 people apprehended were the alleged leaders of the group, who the RCMP identified as 41-year-old Sean Bixby, 38-year-old David Langhorn and 43-year-old Dwayne Smith. They are facing dozens of drug trafficking charges. \"Organized crime groups use proceeds of drug trafficking to fund further criminal activity. These arrests make a positive impact for our community by closing off what had been a profitable operation that supported organized crime in southern Ontario,\" said RCMP Insp Henry Tillo, who is the officer-in-charge of Golden Horseshoe Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit (CFSEU). The unit, comprised of RCMP, Hamilton police, Niagara police, Brantford police, Six Nations police officers and the Canada Border Services Agency, led the investigation into the case.

Silk brand almond milk, coconut milk, almond-coconut milk and oat milk, as well as Great Value brand almond milk, were recalled earlier this month. \"At this point in time, the Ministry of Health can confirm that 2 deaths in Ontario have been related to this outbreak,\" a spokesperson told CP24 in an email. \"The Ministry of Health is working closely with Local Public Health Agencies, Public Health Ontario, the CFIA, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada regarding the recall of these products.\" At least 12 lab-confirmed cases of listeriosis have been reported in connection with the recall, including 10 in Ontario and one each in Quebec and Nova Scotia. All of the affected products, of which there are 18, include the product code 7825 and best-before dates up to and including Oct. 4. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), products contaminated with listeria may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick and include symptoms like vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness. “Pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, the infection can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth. In severe cases of illness, people may die,” PHAC said in the recall. READ MORE: What is listeriosis, the illness recently linked to a recall of plant-based milks? Of the reported listeriosis cases in Canada, 67 per cent were reported in women and the ages of those hospitalized are between 37 and 89. PHAC said the people who became sick developed symptoms between August 2023 and early July 2024. Health officials warned that more infections may continue to be reported as the illness reporting period for this outbreak is between nine and 35 days. In a statement issued Wednesday, the president of Danone Canada, Frédéric Guichard, said all 15 of the Silk products have been removed from shelves across the country. \"The news in this notice is devastating and our most sincere sympathies go out to the families and loved ones during this difficult time,” he said. It’s unclear if the three Great Value products, which are produced by Walmart, are still on the shelves. If you believe you have one of the affected products in your home, PHAC advises to throw the items out or return them to where they were purchased.    \n",

The storm, which dumped a month's worth of rain on the city in a matter of hours, overwhelmed sewer systems and waterways, causing damage and hampering transit. While such storms are rare, they are not unheard of. Another storm about a decade ago in 2013 caused major flooding, submerging vehicles and necessitating the rescue of passengers from a half-submerged GO Train. With more adverse weather expected due to climate change, the city has undertaken flood mitigation work over the past decade, including a massive project to reroute the mouth of the Don River to add flood protection in the Port Lands – a project which marked a major milestone just last week and which is expected to be compete by the end of this year. But the fact that the city has undertaken flood protection work over the past few years left some wondering why the city was then so overwhelmed by Tuesday's storm. Speaking on CTV Your Morning Wednesday, Mayor Olivia Chow said flood mitigation is at various stages of work in areas across the city, with some projects still waiting for dollars to flow. \"The west area, still some of those homeowners can't even get insurance for their basements because they've been flooding so much,\" Chow said. \"So we're waiting for the federal government to join us to really do flood mitigation measures in the west end of the city. It's about $300 million, and they've said yes, it's just we're waiting for the funds to flow.\" Chow said the city also has \"very, very aggressive\" plans to build more housing in the East Harbour area, east of the Don River, but is also waiting on about $200 million from the federal government for flood protection. However she did note that Ottawa has contributed in a \"big\" way to flood protection with the project to naturalize the mouth of the Don River. One of the massive concrete \"plugs\" separating the newly-created stretch of river was removed last week. Once all of the plugs have been removed, the river will flow out through the new mouth, instead of emptying into the narrow Keating Channel. \"The last plug about to be pulled out in the next couple of months, that will allow the Don River to flow into Lake Ontario, and that would ease a lot of the flooding,\" Chow said. \"So it's happening, but we're almost there.\" In a post, Waterfront Toronto confirmed that while a small amount of water from the Don River entered the new stretch of river, the project was not at a stage of completion that would have allowed water to flow through to the new mouth Tuesday. \"A small notch was also recently made at the west end of the North Plug to allow for construction of the riverbank where it meets the wall. Some water and debris flowed into the new river here, and the water level was a little higher than usual,\" Waterfront Toronto said in its post. \"Otherwise, the storm did not impact the construction site and increased waters from the Don River were still moving by way of the Keating Channel.\" However the organization also noted that the project is not meant to protect all areas that were affected by Tuesday's flooding. \"The Port Lands Flood Protection project is designed to protect the Port Lands and portions of Leslieville and South Riverdale in a storm even bigger than yesterday's. It is not designed to mitigate flooding on the Don Valley Parkway, which remains within the Don River flood plain.\" Speaking with CP24 Tuesday, Environment Canada Senior Climatologist Dave Phillips said that while the city might typically see one or two thunderstorms with heavy rain in a month, Tuesday brought three in quick succession and the infrastructure was not designed to cope. \"So huge amounts of rain and the system, the city infrastructure, couldn't take it. It was overworked. He pointed out that Toronto is \"a different city\" than it was about 20 or 30 years ago, with far more concrete surfaces and less green space that could absorb heavy rainfall. Chow reiterated Wednesday that the city has been looking at ways to encourage people not to pave their properties over with nonporous surfaces. \"We want to do more. For big parking lots, if it's just concrete, the water basically just runs off,\" Chow said. \"What we want them to do is have interlocking bricks, so that the water can seep into the ground, rather than just run off and flood everything else.\" Earlier this year, staff proposed a separate tax be added to utility bills as a fixed charge, depending on the size of the paved area on a property.  The move led to cries that Toronto was trying to add a \"rain tax.\" Chow directed staff to take another look following an outcry, but said at the time that it was important to have a plan that supports more green infrastructure, prevents flooding, and keeps water bills low.    \n",

The Honda Indy held a press conference at the Exhibition Grounds on Thursday where some of the drivers who will compete in this weekend’s races spoke with reporters. But one of them almost didn’t make it. Lochie Hughes, an Australian driver who competes in the USF Pro 2000 series, told reporters that he nearly missed the event due to the traffic and had to eventually find another way to get to the track. “I am just super happy to be here in Toronto. I got stuck in traffic as well so I actually rented a bike to get here on time and then ran the rest of the way,” he said. “It is cool to just be outside along the water there. It reminds me a little bit of back home in Australia, people outdoors playing tennis.” The westbound lanes of Lake Shore Boulevard West are closed from Strachan Avenue to British Columbia Drive in order to accommodate the annual street race and police have previously warned drivers to expect “significant delays” in the area. Hughes might not have gotten that message but he was nonetheless in good spirits on Thursday as he spoke about his impressions of the city. “There are Smarties here. At our hotel we have Smarties so I feel right at home,” he said. Hughes isn’t the only visitor to Toronto who has had to alter their plans due to the city’s notorious gridloick. Last month former One Direction member Niall Horan made headlines after he posted a video which showed him walking to the Scotiabank Arena for a performance because the city’s traffic was “too bad.” In the video, which was sped up and had The Proclaimer’s “I’m Gonna Be (500 miles)” playing in the background, Horan was seen walking from just west of Yonge Street to an underground entrance of Scotiabank Arena past Bay Street. “In all the years I’ve been playing shows, I don’t think I’ve ever walked into a venue,” Horan said in the video. Hughes is scheduled to compete in two USF Pro 2000 series races this weekend. The main event, the NTT INDYCAR SERIES race, will wrap up a weekend of racing at 1:30 p.m. on Sunday.    \n",

The 450 grocery stores that are licensed to sell alcohol in Ontario are permitted to order ready-to-drink beverages and larger packs of beer as of today, meaning that the beverages could start showing up on some store shelves relatively soon. The province had previously set a date of August 1 to allow grocery stores to sell ready-to-drink cocktails but announced earlier this week that it was moving up the timeline. Ready-to-drink beverages have been at the forefront of the LCBO strike, with the Ontario Public Service Employees Union previously identifying it as a key issue for his members. Premier Doug Ford, for his part, has said that he is unwilling to budge when it comes to its government’s plans to allow grocers to sell ready-to-drink cocktails. “If they want to negotiate over RTD (Ready-To-Drink beverages), the deal is off,” Ford told reporters at a news conference in Etobicoke last week. “Let me be very clear. It is done, it is gone. That ship has sailed. It’s halfway across Lake Ontario.” LCBO outlets across Ontario have been shuttered since talks broke down and about 9.000 OPSEU members walked off the job on July 5. Talks between the union and the province resumed on Wednesday and are continuing today, OPSEU has told CTV News Toronto. Meanwhile, the province continues to move ahead with its plans to expand the sale of some alcoholic beverages. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance told CP24.com earlier this week that the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario has issued licenses to 3,153 convenience stores to sell beer, wine, cider and ready-to-drink beverages since applications first opened on June 17. An additional 54 grocery stores have also been issued licenses. “In less than two months, on September 5, the Ontario marketplace will hit a new milestone with all eligible convenience stores able to sell beer, cider, wine, and ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages. As the first segment of the market to be expanded, we are pleased that so many convenience stores are gearing up to provide people with more choice,” Colin Blachar said. “As the province implements its plan, the government will continue to constantly evaluate how it can deliver choice and convenience.” The Ontario government has previously indicated that the LCBO will retain the exclusive right to sell spirits in Ontario, even as it allows more retailers to sell other alcoholic beverages.    \n",

                                         Thursday, July 18, 2024 1:31PM EDT Police are warning the public after a large quantity of unapproved prescription drugs were seized during a recent raid in York Region. York Regional Police (YRP) launched an investigation into the trafficking of controlled substances in Vaughan in May. On July 11, police executed a search warrant at a home near Highway 7 and Woodstream Boulevard, east of Martin Grove Road. Police say that officers recovered an “abundance” of prescription drugs that have not been approved by regulatory authorities for “safety, efficacy and quality or for sale in Canada.” The drugs include anabolic steroids, hormone receptors, testosterone replacements, synthetic steroids, erectile dysfunction medications, and opiates. Police said they also seized a quantity of pills they believe to be MDMA as well as two fraudulently registered motor vehicles. Two Vaughan residents have been charged. Jamal Hassan, 29 and Ashley Cunningham, 34, are both facing drug-related charges. “York Regional Police is reminding the public that prescription drugs being sold on the illegal market are often imported from overseas and do not have the same stringent safety regulations as Health Canada,” police said in a news release. “No prescription drugs should be purchased from unlicensed sources, as they may not contain the product that is being advertised. This includes unknown ingredients, incorrect dosages and contamination. Consuming these products can lead to serious health consequences, including hospitalization or even death. Always use legitimate channels to obtain prescription medications safely.” Police continue to investigate and are asking anyone with information to contact investigators.    \n",

The area was particularly hit hard by Tuesday’s rainfall and the water levels in Kunsang’s basement reached knee-high height, destroying furniture and toppling over large appliances as the storm surged. “This place, it was like a movie. When this happens to your own house, your brain stops working,” he said. Toronto flooding: Pictures, videos show heavy rainfall in downtown core Eric Swanson lives nearby and saw at least a foot of water in his home’s lower level, despite installing a pressure-sealing door and powered backwater valve in the basement. “Do we call insurance? Do we not call insurance? The mould and the disgustingness of the water and all those issues…I need to get this properly cleaned and taken care of so that my house is still livable,” Swanson said. Homes weren’t the only things damaged in the record-breaking storm, which saw nearly 100 millimetres of rainfall in just a few hours. Several vehicles were also abandoned by their drivers after water gushed onto major roadways across the city, including the Don Valley Parkway where 14 people needed to be rescued. The torrential downpour is already being compared to Toronto’s 2013 storm – listed as one of the most expensive natural disasters in Canada, according to insurance payouts. Data from the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) shows that claims filed in the aftermath of that weather event reached $1 billion. While it’s too early to put a dollar figure on the damage left it the aftermath of Tuesday’s storm, the IBC told CTV News Toronto that the two events are “similar.” “We can’t determine, at this point, what the magnitude of this event is,” Anne Marie Thomas, IBC’s director of consumer and industry relations, said. “We can’t say what this event will cost because, as you can imagine, not everyone has filed an insurance claim yet.” Insurance tips for flooded house, car If your basement was flooded or you needed to abandon your vehicle, the first thing you should do is reach out to you insurer or insurance broker to check your coverage. “Not all [insurance] policies have coverage for weather events like this one,” Thomas said, adding that sewer backup coverage and overland flood coverage would be needed in the case of home insurance, both of which are optional and not always included in basic policies. “A typical homeowner's insurance policy doesn't cover damage caused by sewer backup or flood. It only covers [damage] caused by a burst pipe or something like that in your home,” she said. After you’ve determined what type of coverage you have, the next step is making an inventory of all the damaged items, including taking pictures and videos of those items. If you have proof of purchase, such as a receipt, for an item you’re looking to make a claim for, that will assist in the process. One important note is to hold on to any damaged items before you dispose of them, because, as Thomas explains, the insurance adjuster will want to see the damage as it was at the time of the event. “So if your house is damaged, and you go, ‘OK, I'm just gonna get rid of this.’ Wait until your insurance company says it's okay. Unless that item is posing a health hazard or is a danger,” she said.

In terms of vehicle insurance for owners who were forced to ditch their vehicle amid the flooding, much like home insurance, only certain policies will cover the damage. “In order for those vehicles to be covered by insurance, the owner of the vehicle would have to have purchased collision or comprehensive coverage or ‘all perils’ coverage,” Thomas said. “Those are the optional physical damage coverages that you can buy for your car. If you have that, then your insurance company would pay to either fix the vehicle or write off your vehicle.” Typically, following a storm like the one on Tuesday, Thomas said the full “realization” of the damage isn’t known until 30 to 45 days after the event.    \n",

Don Valley Parkway in recent months. The Toronto Police Service (TPS) said it first received reports that two vehicles had been damaged by falling objects in the area of Pottery Road and Broadview Avenue in March. Officers determined that the vehicles had been damaged by “various sizes of metal BBs and glass marbles,” police said in a release issued Thursday. Police said they do not know where the objects originated from or who may be responsible. Police said they received a third report in July of a vehicle in the same area damaged by falling objects.

The North York Harvest Food Bank says it suffered around $50,000 in lost food and damage from the flooding, hampering its ability to provide to those in need. Natasha Bowes, director of development and marketing for the food bank, told CP24 Thursday that the rain overwhelmed their systems. \"It ended up backing up onto our loading docks. We were trying to rescue the food. The power went out,\" she said. The organization tried to transport some of the food to a cold storage facility, but much of it was lost. \"Then while we were trying to save the food that we had in the fridges, we ended up damaging one of our trucks. There was some water damage. So just things built, one over another. Our freezer is already broken. So we're really calling out for the community to help us right now.\" The food bank issued an urgent appeal after the damage. \"Our loading bays are flooded, our freezer is broken, and water is pouring into our warehouse,\" the group said on its website. \"The power outage caused us to lose a significant amount of refrigerated food, including milk, cheese, meat, and nutritious kids snacks intended to nourish our community.\" They are calling for cash donations to help with the recovery, as well as canned goods. \"They can drop it off at their local fire stations. We have donation boxes at grocery stores across North York, and also here at 116 Industry Street,\" Bowes said. She pointed out that the food bank has seen a high level of usage in the community recently, so the timing is difficult. \"The cost of food, inflation, rent in Toronto is just absolutely insane – so the amount of people that are coming, it was a record month for us,\" Bowes said. \"We've never seen this many people come through the doors and it just keeps going up and up.\"    \n",

Urbanation Inc. says that just 3,159 new condo units were sold in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area during the first half of the year, representing a 57 per cent decline from the same time period one year prior and a 72 per cent drop as compared to the 10-year average. Urbanation says that it was also the slowest first half for new condo sales since 1997. “With condo prices still near record highs and only a modest 25 basis point decline in interest rates in June from their 22-year high, buyers remained cautious in anticipation of further rate cuts and amidst a burgeoning supply of units for sale,” Urbanation President Shaun Hildebrand said in a news release. “The continued weakening in condo market conditions during the second quarter of 2024 is likely to cause more projects that were slated to launch this year to remain on hold, while others that are struggling to meet sales thresholds for construction financing may ultimately be pulled from the market.” Urbanation says that the total number of unsold condo units in the GTHA has now reached a record high of 25,89, which equates to about 34 months of supply. That is approximately 10,000 more units than the long-term average, the group points out. However, despite the surplus prices have remained relatively stable. Urbanation says that the average asking price for unsold units declined just 2.6 per cent over the past year and by only 4.5 per cent over the past two years. “This demonstrates how sticky new condominium prices have become due to high development and financing costs, and record prices paid for land at the market peak,” the release notes. The GTA’s real estate market has faced significant headwinds over the last two years due to a significant increase in the price of borrowing. In June the average selling price of a home in the Greater Toronto Area across all property types was $1,162,167. That is down from a peak of $1,334,062 in February 2022, which was the prior to the Bank of Canada beginning its interest rate hiking cycle.    \n",
              "9    Thursday, July 18, 2024 8:46AM EDT A Toronto rapper's firearm charges have been dropped after a judge found police breached his Charter rights and gave “tailored” testimonies while on the stand. In an Ontario Superior Court decision released last month, Justice Sandra Nishikawa handed Omary Bent, 27, a stay of proceedings. He was acquitted of four firearm charges laid on him in the summer of 2021. The acquittal was granted, in part, after Nishikawa found that the officers used excessive force in dragging Bent out of his Etobicoke condominium by his hair and breached his right to counsel in questioning him without a lawyer present. In turn, the judge found the court should “distance itself” from the evidence obtained during the raid. Download our app to get alerts on your device Get the latest local updates right to your inbox According to court documents, the Toronto Police Service (TPS) began looking into Bent after it was suggested by a confidential source that he’d been dealing drugs and possessed a firearm. Police raided Brent’s home on July 27, 2021, deploying a Taser on him within minutes. According to Bent, he was hit with the energy weapon while his hands were in the air. One of the officers involved, however, said the Taser had been deployed as Bent reached for a satchel that was later found with a loaded pistol inside. Another officer told the court that the Taser had been deployed as Bent walked towards the police with his hand in his pocket. After being Tased, Bent was then dragged shirtless from his home by his hair, the judge found. Bent testified that the officer dragging him said, “I should have f*****g killed you,” before leaving him with another officer in the building’s stairwell. A photograph taken of Bent by his sister, later used as evidence, shows a bald, raw spot where one of his braids had detached from the skin of his scalp. Bent testified that police then asked for access to his vehicle before giving him the chance to speak with a lawyer, at one point threatening to break the windows if he didn’t comply. Police, meanwhile, have insisted that Brent told officers where they could find the keys without coercion. Nothing was found during a police search of the vehicle. Bent did, however, did admit that he threw a guitar case from his 37th floor balcony. Court documents say that a gun was later found inside that case. Police ultimately charged Bent with one count each of possession of a loaded prohibited firearm and possession of a non-restricted firearm without a licence, along with two counts of possession of a prohibited device, namely an over-capacity magazine. 'False and misleading' In examining the testimonies given by the officers on what led them to Taser Bent, the judge found one of the officer’s accounts “impossible to accept.” She ruled that his testimony that Brent had reached for a satchel contradicted not only the accounts of other officers present but his own. In a report made prior to giving his testimony, the officer had stated Bent had dropped his hands and made no mention of a satchel. In that report, the officer had checked ‘yes’ under ‘Subject Confirmed Armed.’ Bent was not found to be armed. “In this case, checking “yes” [...] was false and misleading,” the judge wrote in her decision. “In my view, [the officer] completed the CEW Report in a manner that would avoid questioning of his use of a Taser.” The judge also took issue with the testimony of three other officers who said they did not recall if Bent had been shirtless at the time of the raid or not. The judge found their accounts inaccurate and described them as an effort to suggest Bent may have had a hidden weapon. “In my view, the officers’ subsequent attempt to justify the use of force by different after-the-fact explanations belies any good faith belief in the necessity of using force at the time,” she wrote. Ultimately, Nishikawa ruled that the deployment of the Taser constituted an excessive use of force and in turn, violated Bent’s Charter rights. The request made by officers for Bent to hand over his keys before speaking to a lawyer was also deemed a breach of rights. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for the Toronto Police Service said that an adverse comment made by a judge cannot be taken as a definitive ruling on officer conduct. “It is important to understand that negative judicial comments do not necessarily constitute misconduct,” Stephanie Sayer wrote in an email to CTV News Toronto. “When officers are testifying in court, they are not the ones on trial. Like any witness, the officers are not parties to the proceeding – they have no right to representation, no ability to call witnesses or make submissions, no right to make legal arguments, etc. They are there to answer the questions posed to them.” In this case, Sayer said the Crown had reviewed the officers’ testimony and found no evidence of misconduct. Still, she said the service’s Professional Standards Unit was investigating the allegations. Case does damage to trust in policing: Lawyer Bent’s lawyers, Hilary Dudding and Maxime Bédard, told CTV News Toronto that the case serves as an important lesson in public trust in policing. “It's so important that the public feel confident in the police and feel that the police are going to be enforcing laws fairly and within the boundary of the law themselves,” Dudding said. “Even one case like this does damage to the trust that the community has in the police service.” “Police are like every other group of people,” she continued. “There's always going to be frailty there, but looking at a system that takes this more seriously and provides some accountability to the public when this happens is really, really important.” Dudding added that it shouldn’t be left up to individuals to face off against the authorities in court, and put forth the idea of a public oversight body tasked with reviewing these kinds of claims more strenuously. “When an internal process takes place, one wonders how many of these complaints are reviewed or how seriously they're taken, and what the consequences are,” she continued. “We’d all benefit from a more strenuous approach to these things, because we need to focus on the issues that really matter in court, as opposed to trying to figure out what really happened during an engagement with the police.” In unrelated proceedings, Bent is facing a charge of second-degree murder in connection with the stabbing of 24-year-old Shacquan Harrison . He is scheduled to stand trial in late 2024 or early 2025.    \n",

Thursday, July 18, 2024 10:43AM EDT Police have arrested three individuals and seized a dozen stolen vehicles following a raid at an alleged “chop shop” in Milton. Halton police say that investigators with its organized crime unit began an investigation on July 11 after identifying a recently stolen vehicle from Peel Region at a rural address in Milton. Police say that officers subsequently executed a search warrant at the property and arrested three individuals at the scene. Police say that 12 stolen vehicles “in various stages of being disassembled” were also recovered. Haider Ameer Khan, 25, of Brampton, Shehroz Nadeem, 26, of Mississauga and Jaskaran Sing, 24, of Grimsby, are each charged with 12 counts of possession of property obtained by crime over $5,000 and one count of trafficking in possession of property obtained by crime over $5,000. Police say that Khan had also been subject to a prior release order at the time of his arrest for similar offences. All three suspects have since been released on bail and are due back in court on Aug. 26. Police continue to investigate and are asking anyone with information to contact investigators.    \n",

The operation that unfolded over the course of 12 hours on Tuesday following torrential rains eventually saw more than 100 residents safely moved out of the nursing home, some by raft and others on foot once the water receded. Mississauga Fire Captain Dan Herd said the evacuation of the Tyndall Seniors Village, which saw multiple emergency services from across the Greater Toronto Area come together, was on a scale he hadn't seen before. \"There was water inside the building, the first floor – in between probably three to four feet high on the walls – and some windows were broken, damaged,” Herd said, adding that the parking lot was inundated by water at one point. \"We set up an instant action plan, and we started to move thousands of litres of water at a time ... the water rescue team was using their rescue boats to assist the removal of ambulatory patients and occupants.\" The flooding began after incredibly heavy rains on Tuesday caused the nearby Etobicoke Creek to overflow, Herd said. Once enough floodwater had been pumped out of the home, some residents were able to walk out of the building, he said. Those who were unable to walk were carried down stairs and out of the building by first responders using lifting equipment, Herd said. \"This is my first personal experience of something to this size,” he said of the operation. None of the residents were injured, said Tom Kukolic, acting deputy chief for Peel Region's paramedics service. Once first responders determined that none of the 116 residents needed emergency care, efforts then shifted to a \"safe extrication and relocation\" operation, Kukolic said, with residents eventually taken to two long-term care homes and two hotels. \"Once the paramedics and firefighters were able to bring the residents out of the home and move them to the triage area, we then had assistance from Peel Wheel-Trans, Toronto TTC Wheel-Trans, and Mississauga Transit,” Kukolic said. The relocation effort was “a seamless transition” thanks to the collaboration of several emergency response teams, including York Region and Toronto paramedics, he said. “Extricating people, it’s very difficult. It is very laborious work ... however, what we do from a paramedic practice perspective, is ensure that we have enough people to safely move residents,\" Kukolic said. Tuesday's massive downpour caused chaos across Toronto and its surrounding communities, with flooding shutting down several major routes and terminals and knocking out power to thousands. Mississauga Fire Chief Deryn Rizzi called the response at the nursing home “a great example” of how multiple agencies across the Greater Toronto Area can work together. \"We are there to work collaboratively together, to address the incident to achieve a common goal, which in this case, it was to evacuate the residents safely,\" he said. For Kukolic, the full-day operation showed how preparation can help first responders deal with large-scale responses triggered by sudden events such as Tuesday's flooding. \"I was proud to be a member of paramedic services and a first responder,” he said. \"It was really great to see how everybody came together to ensure that our most vulnerable were taken care of.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 18, 2024.    \n",

                Thursday, July 18, 2024 10:23AM EDT Ford Motor Co. says it plans to assemble its F-Series Super Duty pickup trucks at its Oakville, Ont., assembly plant starting in 2026, adding capacity of up to 100,000 additional units. Ford is spending around US$3 billion to expand Super Duty production, which includes US$2.3 billion to install assembly and integrated stamping operations at the Oakville facility. The company says the move will support 1,800 jobs at the plant. Those positions will be filled by workers represented by Unifor who had previously been expected to return to work in 2027 after Ford announced earlier this year it was delaying the start of electric vehicle production at the plant by two years. The U.S. automaker had said there would be layoffs associated with the delay to its plans to spend $1.8 billion to transform the Oakville site into a hub for electric vehicle manufacturing. It says the increased production also adds around 150 jobs at the company's Windsor Engine Complex, which will manufacture more V8 engines for the Super Duty trucks.

A city spokesperson said three wastewater plants were “ bypassing ,” a process in which stormwater and sewage are diverted from a secondary treatment procedure. IN PHOTOS: A look back at the massive flooding across Toronto “The bypassed wastewater still goes through screening, grit removal, primary treatment, phosphorous removal and full disinfection to ensure the treated water always meets strict federal and provincial regulations,” the spokesperson said, adding that the process is done to protect the plants’ ability to continue treating wastewater during an extreme rainstorm. Health officials have advised against swimming in Lake Ontario for 48 hours after rainfall due to the possible presence of high levels of bacteria. On Wednesday, all of Toronto’s beaches were under a red flag. The 10 beaches were marked unsafe for swimming due to high levels of E.coli in the water. “Much of the sewage that may have been deposited after the storm should be disinfected through exposure to UV through the sunlight. It can be unsafe to swim, even at designated swimming beaches, for up to 48 hours after a major rainfall,” the city said. “Storms increase bacteria in the lake, and 48 hours is long enough for bacteria levels in the lake water to drop or dissipate to ensure that the beach water is again safe enough for swimming.” On Tuesday, thunderstorms brought heavy rainfall within three hours, causing widespread flooding across the city. According to Environment Canada, 97.6 millimetres of rain fell, which is more than a month’s worth of precipitation . In July, Toronto usually receives around 75 millimetres of rain.    \n",

Mendicino, a Toronto Liberal MP, said under the plan anyone who intimidated or otherwise harassed people within the buffer zone of perhaps 50 to 100 metres would be subject to harsher criminal penalties including jail time. In an interview, Mendicino suggested spelling out such zones in regulations that will flow from the recently passed foreign interference bill, which contains new measures to protect essential infrastructure. The former minister's comments come as the attempted assassination of ex-U.S. president Donald Trump prompts renewed concern and discussion about the safety of Canadian politicians. \"We have to take parliamentary security more seriously,\" Mendicino said. \"We need as Canadians to open our eyes and recognize that political violence is not something that just occurs somewhere else, but that it is happening here in our own communities.\" People have constitutional rights to express a point of view and disagree with fellow Canadians including parliamentarians, he said. \"But it's also true that we're seeing more threats, more intimidation, more harassment, which can lead to harm both online and in the community.\" In the last few years, several MPs from different parties have had their constituency offices targeted, including graffiti spray-painted on the exterior and rocks thrown through windows. Mendicino says he has received \"a barrage of death threats\" and that his family has also been targeted. A man recently spat on the MP in Ottawa as he walked to his office. He and his constituency staff have become more prudent about booking appointments with members of the public, devoting more effort to vetting and screening. Housing Minister Sean Fraser says he, too, has received death threats. \"My home has been outfitted with a greater degree of security than I feel is ordinary or that I'm personally even comfortable with,\" he said in an interview. \"But when security officials tell you they need to make certain decisions in your best interest when it comes to personal safety and security, you listen to them.\" Police have provided more protection to federal politicians from various parties in recent years. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said this week he worries about his family's safety, and that he had sought protection in response to menacing behaviour. Mendicino, who was minister responsible for the national police force from October 2021 to July last year, said he \"always found that the RCMP were prepared to step up.\" \"But it's my view that they continue to need more resources, that local law enforcement needs more resources, and that we should leave all options on the table when it comes to creating new authorities for them\" to help prevent harassment, he added. RCMP commissioner Mike Duheme recently said he wanted the government to look at drafting a new law that would make it easier for police to pursue charges against people who threaten elected officials. However, Justice Minister Arif Virani subsequently suggested existing Criminal Code provisions were sufficient. Mendicino said the government needs to press social media companies to do more to ensure online spaces are free of invective and harassment. He also acknowledges \"politicians need to look in the mirror themselves.\" \"And I don't think it's particularly helpful to point fingers and say one party is more guilty of of engaging in extreme rhetoric than the other. I think we've got a collective responsibility to raise the bar of political debate,\" he said. Overall, he worries \"that the trends are all moving in the wrong direction.\" Unless the problem is taken seriously, it will spur more political violence and make it harder to attract and retain good people in politics, Mendicino added. \"I'm going to continue to speak out on this issue to prevent that from happening.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 18, 2024. — With a file from Alessia Passafiume    \n",

The storm, which dumped a month's worth of rain on the city in a matter of hours, overwhelmed sewer systems and waterways, causing damage and hampering transit. While such storms are rare, they are not unheard of. Another storm about a decade ago in 2013 caused major flooding, submerging vehicles and necessitating the rescue of passengers from a half-submerged GO Train. With more adverse weather expected due to climate change, the city has undertaken flood mitigation work over the past decade, including a massive project to reroute the mouth of the Don River to add flood protection in the Port Lands – a project which marked a major milestone just last week and which is expected to be compete by the end of this year. But the fact that the city has undertaken flood protection work over the past few years left some wondering why the city was then so overwhelmed by Tuesday's storm. Speaking on CTV Your Morning Wednesday, Mayor Olivia Chow said flood mitigation is at various stages of work in areas across the city, with some projects still waiting for dollars to flow. \"The west area, still some of those homeowners can't even get insurance for their basements because they've been flooding so much,\" Chow said. \"So we're waiting for the federal government to join us to really do flood mitigation measures in the west end of the city. It's about $300 million, and they've said yes, it's just we're waiting for the funds to flow.\" Chow said the city also has \"very, very aggressive\" plans to build more housing in the East Harbour area, east of the Don River, but is also waiting on about $200 million from the federal government for flood protection. However she did note that Ottawa has contributed in a \"big\" way to flood protection with the project to naturalize the mouth of the Don River. One of the massive concrete \"plugs\" separating the newly-created stretch of river was removed last week. Once all of the plugs have been removed, the river will flow out through the new mouth, instead of emptying into the narrow Keating Channel. \"The last plug about to be pulled out in the next couple of months, that will allow the Don River to flow into Lake Ontario, and that would ease a lot of the flooding,\" Chow said. \"So it's happening, but we're almost there.\" In a post, Waterfront Toronto confirmed that while a small amount of water from the Don River entered the new stretch of river, the project was not at a stage of completion that would have allowed water to flow through to the new mouth Tuesday. \"A small notch was also recently made at the west end of the North Plug to allow for construction of the riverbank where it meets the wall. Some water and debris flowed into the new river here, and the water level was a little higher than usual,\" Waterfront Toronto said in its post. \"Otherwise, the storm did not impact the construction site and increased waters from the Don River were still moving by way of the Keating Channel.\" However the organization also noted that the project is not meant to protect all areas that were affected by Tuesday's flooding. \"The Port Lands Flood Protection project is designed to protect the Port Lands and portions of Leslieville and South Riverdale in a storm even bigger than yesterday's. It is not designed to mitigate flooding on the Don Valley Parkway, which remains within the Don River flood plain.\" Speaking with CP24 Tuesday, Environment Canada Senior Climatologist Dave Phillips said that while the city might typically see one or two thunderstorms with heavy rain in a month, Tuesday brought three in quick succession and the infrastructure was not designed to cope. \"So huge amounts of rain and the system, the city infrastructure, couldn't take it. It was overworked. He pointed out that Toronto is \"a different city\" than it was about 20 or 30 years ago, with far more concrete surfaces and less green space that could absorb heavy rainfall. Chow reiterated Wednesday that the city has been looking at ways to encourage people not to pave their properties over with nonporous surfaces. \"We want to do more. For big parking lots, if it's just concrete, the water basically just runs off,\" Chow said. \"What we want them to do is have interlocking bricks, so that the water can seep into the ground, rather than just run off and flood everything else.\" Earlier this year, staff proposed a separate tax be added to utility bills as a fixed charge, depending on the size of the paved area on a property.  The move led to cries that Toronto was trying to add a \"rain tax.\" Chow directed staff to take another look following an outcry, but said at the time that it was important to have a plan that supports more green infrastructure, prevents flooding, and keeps water bills low.    \n",

There is a \"smattering\" of services available, said Katreena Scott, academic director of the Centre for Research and Education on Violence Against Women and Children at Western University, but it is too few and far between. \"The reality in Ontario is that we live, right now, in a system where if there is somebody who is engaging in — or is at risk for — hurtful, abusive or coercive behaviour, it's very, very difficult to find and get help,\" Scott told a legislative committee studying intimate partner violence. \"Really, what has to happen is they need to wait until they're involved in the criminal justice system.\" The Progressive Conservative government said this spring that it would support an NDP bill to declare intimate partner violence an epidemic, but then-government house leader Paul Calandra also tasked the justice committee with a broader study of the issue. Those hearings began Wednesday. The move came nearly a year after the province rejected calls from an inquest into the deaths of three women at the hands of their former partner to make the declaration, saying it couldn't label intimate partner violence an epidemic because it was not an infectious or communicable disease. The jury at a coroner’s inquest into the 2015 deaths of Nathalie Warmerdam, Carol Culleton and Anastasia Kuzyk in Renfrew County made 86 recommendations aimed at preventing similar tragedies. One of those recommendations was to establish a 24-hour hotline for men who need support to prevent them from engaging in such violence, but the government has not yet acted on it. Experts at the legislative committee Wednesday held up an Alberta program as a good example of support for prevention, which offers men counselling, a 24-hour telephone support line, online resources and toolkits. Lana Wells, an associate professor at the University of Calgary and a domestic violence researcher, said men are predominantly the perpetrators of intimate partner violence and a provincial strategy to end it must include supports for them. \"When men and boys can emotionally self-regulate, embody gender-equitable norms and behaviours, have the skills to disrupt sexism, violence within themselves and their peers, embrace non-violence, have the skills to heal, repair and manage conflict, be accountable, and actively inspire their peers, colleagues and children to do the same, then we can stop violence before it starts,\" she told the committee. \"So what can Ontario do to advance this area? I think really focusing on removing the burden from victims and victimology and start to focus our attention on the people and systems that are causing harm.\" Better data is also needed that can speak to prevention, Wells said, as most of the research in this area has focused on victims. There needs to be more information on any patterns that precede domestic violence and what factors can lead people to become perpetrators in order to disrupt those trajectories, she said. The Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services said it spent more than $350 million in the last fiscal year on services to address and prevent gender-based violence, including more than $10 million in violence-prevention initiatives. \"Everyone has the right to live free from fear, exploitation, intimidation, and the threat of violence,\" the ministry wrote in a statement. \"That is why our government is working to prevent intimate partner violence before it occurs.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 17, 2024.    \n",

Jennie Carignan was a little emotional on Thursday as she spoke to reporters about what it means to take over command of the Canadian Armed Forces. It's an honour that felt like the natural next step in her career, she said, something she's worked toward for the last 38 years. It also means, for other women or marginalized people, that \"it's possible, folks — the door is open.\" \"This is actually what my parents used to tell me: 'Anything is possible. You can do anything,'\" she said. \"But I realized in 1986 that that was not necessarily true for everybody. Even if the doors were open, perceptions stay. There's unconscious biases that, frankly, I do have to question, myself, regularly.\" Carignan became chief of the defence staff in a ceremony at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa on Thursday morning, taking over from Gen. Wayne Eyre, who is set to retire after three years in the job. \"I feel ready, poised and supported to take on this manifold challenge,\" Carignan said at the ceremony, with dignitaries including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Gov. Gen. Mary Simon looking on. \"So I embark on my tenure as your chief of defence staff with confidence. Confidence in our team, in our partners and in Canadians. We've got this,\" she said. There are some big challenges ahead for the Armed Forces and its new leader. Carignan said her first priority is recruiting more Canadians to join the military, and keeping existing troops in uniform. There are more than 16,000 vacant positions in the military, with shortfalls throughout its various ranks and professions. At the same time, more than 70,000 people applied to join the Armed Forces in the last year — but just over 4,300 actually got in. The government's defence policy says modernized recruitment processes are aimed at rebuilding the military by 2032. Carignan said she will start gathering her team to figure out how to make that happen faster. \"Recruiting personnel is a complex affair,\" she said. \"If we can get the momentum and get more people in, then sometimes it has a contagious effect.\" For the last three years, Carignan led the office of professional conduct and culture, which was created as a result of the sexual misconduct scandal in 2021. Culture change is still \"at the heart of everything we do,\" she said, adding that in 2021, her office set a course to create \"irreversible change\" over five years. Carignan said she believes the military is still well on track to meet that target. \"We will always deal with misconduct, but it's how we navigate,\" she said. There is another five-year timeline she's thinking about, too. Carignan told reporters that based on talks with allies, she believes Canada has about five years to get ready to face a new set of threats — conventional military threats from adversaries like China, Russia and Iran, as well as emerging threats like disinformation. \"I think Canadians need to understand that if we are not ready, we might not be able to react appropriately in defence of them,\" she said. Defence Minister Bill Blair said his government feels a sense of urgency to get the Armed Forces the equipment it needs. His department has pledged to overhaul the notoriously slow and bureaucratic procurement system. \"We have to be ready to meet the moment,\" he said, cautioning that building new ships and planes is not a quick process. In his comments at the ceremony Eyre spoke about \"what could be existential threats,\" and said Canada has a history of being unprepared at the outset of wars. \"The security situation out there is not getting any better and we will continue to face many crises, often stacked one upon the other,\" he said. \"To do our part in the free world, we need to be at our own peak capability and readiness, and thus peak deterrence, to meet that threat.\" Carignan brings \"highly relevant experience\" to her role, Eyre said. He told her in French: \"You are ready for this role, and you deserve it.\" She was the first woman to command a combat unit in the Canadian military, and her career has included deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Syria. Following the formal handover of power, Trudeau thanked Eyre, saying he was \"the exact right person to help lead Canada through incredibly difficult times.\" He praised Carignan as someone of the right calibre to take over, and pointed out she is the first woman to lead the military of any G20 country. \"You've demonstrated time and time again the ability to lead with both strength and flexibility,\" Trudeau said. \"You've shown a tremendous sense of agility, vision and courage.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 18, 2024. — With files from Alessia Passafiume.    \n",

Wednesday's agenda and its theme of \"Make America Strong Once Again\" will give leaders around the world insight into the potential impact of a second Donald Trump presidency. \"No NATO. I want America strong,\" said Kimberly Nguyen, wearing a star-spangled dress and draped in a Trump 2024 flag outside the convention. Trump, who was officially confirmed as the Republican presidential candidate on Monday, has mused about increased tariffs, been critical of aid to Ukraine and repeatedly claimed he would not defend NATO members that don't meet defence spending targets, of which Canada is one. During a NATO leaders' summit in Washington last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to meet the spending target, which is the equivalent of two per cent of gross domestic product, by 2032. However, he has been criticized for the lengthy timeline and the lack of detail on how Ottawa will make it happen. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who is riding high in the polls, would not commit to the alliance's spending target, saying he doesn't make promises he can't keep. Trudeau faced a push from provincial leaders to speed up the spending timeline during a premiers' meeting in Halifax earlier Wednesday. Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew expressed concerns that failing to meet the target could jeopardize Canada's trading relationship with the U.S., particularly if there is a change in administration. Outside the Republican convention, there was little empathy for Canada's defence spending delay. Trump supporter Amy Lee said she supports the defensive alliance, but members must meet their commitments. \"Trudeau, we need you to pay your fair share to NATO,\" Lee said. All member countries directly contribute to the alliance's operations at an agreed-upon formula, and Canada pays its required share of that. Canada is one of about a dozen members that are not reaching the two per cent of GDP threshold for defence spending, though only seven members, including the U.S., spend more than Canada in real dollars. Top diplomats from around the world are at the convention to make inroads ahead of a possible second Trump presidency and to push Republicans away from some pledges the former president has made about defence alliances and trade. Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., said some Republicans have an isolationist bent. Many others, she said, understand that “America cannot be strong without having strong alliances.” “There is no singular voice on foreign policy as it relates to a number of issues at this point in the Republican Party,\" Hillman said in Milwaukee. Trump isn't officially scheduled to speak at the convention until Thursday, but has appeared each night of the convention, his right ear covered in a white bandage after it was pierced by a bullet when a man with an assault weapon fired from a rooftop near a rally Saturday afternoon. A rally attendee was killed and two others critically injured, before the gunman was shot dead by a member of the Secret Service. Wednesday was the first opportunity for Trump's running mate JD Vance to introduce himself to the world and he used his time to praise the former president, criticize Biden's foreign policy and highlight how disagreements can make the Republican party stronger. \"We will make sure our allies share in the burden of securing world peace. No more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Vance said. The 39-year-old Ohio senator has built a reputation during his short time in politics for fighting against current U.S. foreign policy and aid to Ukraine. Vance argued against further funding to the war-ravaged country in a column for the New York Times in April, and told the Munich Security Conference earlier this year that he was there to deliver a \"wake-up call\" that America's interests must come first. Trudeau has been one of the most outspoken NATO leaders in support of Ukraine, including at last week's leaders' summit. Vans with screens on the side were driving around the entrances of the convention Wednesday, displaying calls for Republicans to stand with Ukraine. The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, which funded the mobile messaging, said that was intended to remind Republicans that standing with Ukraine helps to defeat America's enemies. Hillman said Vance has some views on international and domestic policy that do not align with \"Canadian values in some circumstances and certainly our government policy in others.\" But, she said, Vance represents Ohio, which has a massive trading relationship with Canada. More than a third of the state's exports go to Canada. “Having someone with that understanding of the importance of the Canada-U.S. economic relationship is a good thing for Canada.” The vice president pick also has a Canadian connection: Jamil Jivani, the recently elected Conservative MP for Durham, has called Vance his best friend from Yale.

In a news release on Wednesday , the RCMP announced the result of its investigation into the group, which began in 2023 when they uncovered evidence of \"sophisticated drug networking\" in the Golden Horseshoe. Since April 2024, the RCMP said they have executed several warrants in three rounds, resulting in arrests and seizure of large quantities of crystal methamphetamine, cocaine, fentanyl, and prescription pills. In addition, multiple firearms, ammunition, ballistic vests, Canadian currency and other items allegedly used to help in the trafficking operation were also seized, the RCMP said. \"On top of that, several kilograms of suspicious substances have been sent to the lab to be tested for suspected narcotics,\" Mounties added. Among the 19 people apprehended were the alleged leaders of the group, who the RCMP identified as 41-year-old Sean Bixby, 38-year-old David Langhorn and 43-year-old Dwayne Smith. They are facing dozens of drug trafficking charges. \"Organized crime groups use proceeds of drug trafficking to fund further criminal activity. These arrests make a positive impact for our community by closing off what had been a profitable operation that supported organized crime in southern Ontario,\" said RCMP Insp Henry Tillo, who is the officer-in-charge of Golden Horseshoe Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit (CFSEU). The unit, comprised of RCMP, Hamilton police, Niagara police, Brantford police, Six Nations police officers and the Canada Border Services Agency, led the investigation into the case.

Danone Canada president Frédéric Guichard said all 15 of the plant-based milks have been removed from shelves across the country . Health officials warned that more infections may continue to be reported as the illness reporting period for this outbreak is between nine and 35 days . Symptoms include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle   \n",

The storm, which dumped a month's worth of rain on the city in a matter of hours, overwhelmed sewer systems and waterways, causing damage and hampering transit. While such storms are rare, they are not unheard of. Another storm about a decade ago in 2013 caused major flooding, submerging vehicles and necessitating the rescue of passengers from a half-submerged GO Train. With more adverse weather expected due to climate change, the city has undertaken flood mitigation work over the past decade, including a massive project to reroute the mouth of the Don River to add flood protection in the Port Lands – a project which marked a major milestone just last week and which is expected to be compete by the end of this year. But the fact that the city has undertaken flood protection work over the past few years left some wondering why the city was then so overwhelmed by Tuesday's storm. Speaking on CTV Your Morning Wednesday, Mayor Olivia Chow said flood mitigation is at various stages of work in areas across the city, including a massive project to reroute the mouth of the Don River to add flood protection in the Port Lands – a project which marked a major milestone just last week and which is expected to be compete by the end of this year. But the fact that the city has undertaken flood protection work over the past few years left some wondering why the city was then so overwhelmed by Tuesday's storm. Speaking on CTV Your Morning Wednesday, Mayor Olivia Chow said flood mitigation is at various stages of work in areas across the city, with some projects still waiting for dollars to flow. \"The west area, still some of those homeowners can't even get insurance for their basements because they've been flooding so much,\" Chow said. \"So we're waiting for the federal government to join us to really do flood mitigation measures in the west end of the city. It's about $300 million, and they've said yes, it's just we're waiting for the funds to flow.\" Chow said the city also has \"very, very aggressive\" plans to build more housing in the East Harbour area, east of the Don River, but is also waiting on about $200 million from the federal government for flood protection. However she did note that Ottawa has contributed in a \"big\" way to flood protection with the project to naturalize the mouth of the Don River. One of the massive concrete \"plugs\" separating the newly-created stretch of river was removed last week. Once all of the plugs have been removed, the river will flow out through the new mouth, instead of emptying into the narrow Keating Channel. \"The last plug about to be pulled out in the next couple of months, that will allow the Don River to flow into Lake Ontario, and that would ease a lot of the flooding,\" Chow said. \"So it's happening, but we're almost there.\" In a post, Waterfront Toronto confirmed that while a small amount of water from the Don River entered the new stretch of river, the project was not at a stage of completion that would have allowed water to flow through to the new mouth Tuesday. \"A small notch was also recently made at the west end of the North Plug to allow for construction of the riverbank where it meets the wall. Some water and debris flowed into the new river here, and the water level was a little higher than usual,\" Waterfront Toronto said in its post. \"Otherwise, the storm did not impact the construction site and increased waters from the Don River were still moving by way of the Keating Channel.\" However the organization also noted that the river will flow out through the new mouth, instead of emptying into the narrow Keating Channel. \"The last plug about to be pulled out in the next couple of months, that would ease a lot of the flooding,\" Chow said. \"So huge amounts of rain and the system, the system, the city infrastructure, couldn't take it. It was not at a stage of completion that would have allowed water to flow through to the new mouth Tuesday.   \n",

The area was particularly hit hard by Tuesday’s rainfall and the water levels in Kunsang’s basement reached knee-high height, destroying furniture and toppling over large appliances as the storm surged. “I was literally shocked,” he said.

Do we not call insurance? The mould and the disgustingness of the water and all those issues…I need to get this properly cleaned and taken care of so that my house is still livable,” Swanson said. Homes weren’t the only things damaged in the record-breaking storm, which saw nearly 100 millimetres of rainfall in just a few hours. Several vehicles were also abandoned by their drivers after water gushed onto major roadways across the city, including the Don Valley Parkway where 14 people needed to be rescued. The torrential downpour is already being compared to Toronto’s 2013 storm – listed as one of the most expensive natural disasters in Canada, according to insurance payouts. Data from the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) shows that claims filed in the aftermath of that weather event reached $1 billion.

Data from the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) shows that claims filed in the aftermath of that weather event reached $1 billion. While it’s too early to put a dollar figure on the damage left it the aftermath of Tuesday’s storm, the IBC told CTV News Toronto that the two events are “similar.” “We can’t determine, at this point, what the magnitude of this event is,” Anne Marie Thomas, IBC’s director of consumer and industry relations, said. “We can’t say what this event will cost because, as you can imagine, not everyone has filed an insurance claim yet.” Insurance tips for flooded house, car If your basement was flooded or you needed to abandon your vehicle, the first thing you should do is reach out to you insurer or insurance broker to check your coverage. “Not all [insurance] policies have coverage for weather events like this one,” Thomas said, adding that sewer backup coverage and overland flood coverage would be needed in the case of home insurance, both of which are optional and not always included in basic policies. “A typical homeowner's insurance policy doesn't cover damage caused by sewer backup or flood. It only covers [damage] caused by a burst pipe or something like that in your home,” she said. After you’ve determined what type of coverage you have, the next step is making an inventory of all the damaged items, including taking pictures and videos of those items. If you have proof of purchase, such as a receipt, for an item you’re looking to make a claim for, that will assist in the process. One important note is to hold on to any damaged items before you dispose of them, because, as Thomas explains, the insurance adjuster will want to see the damage as it was at the time of the event. “So if your house is damaged, and you go, ‘OK, I'm just gonna get rid of this.’ Wait until your insurance company says it’s okay. Unless that item is posing a health hazard or is a danger,” she said   \n",

The total number of unsold condo units in the GTHA has now reached a record high of 25,89, which equates to about 34 months of supply .

Still, she said the service’s Professional Standards Unit was investigating the allegations. Case does damage to trust in policing: Lawyer Bent’s lawyers, Hilary Dudding and Maxime Bédard, told CTV News Toronto that the case serves as an important lesson in public trust in policing. “It's so important that the public feel confident in the police and feel that the police are going to be enforcing laws fairly and within the boundary of the law themselves,” Dudding said. “Even one case like this does damage to the trust that the community has in the police service.” “Police are like every other group of people,” she continued. “There's always going to be frailty there, but looking at a system that takes this more seriously and provides some accountability to the public when this happens is really, really important.” Dudding added that it shouldn’t be left up to individuals to face off against the authorities in court, and put forth the idea of a public oversight body tasked with reviewing these kinds of claims more strenuously. “When an internal process takes place, one wonders how many of these complaints are reviewed or how seriously they're taken, and what the consequences are.” Dudding added that the Toronto Police Service (TPS) began looking into Bent after it was suggested by a confidential source that he’d been dealing drugs and possessed a firearm. Police raided Brent’s home on July 27, 2021, deploying a Taser on him within minutes. According to Bent, he was hit with the energy weapon while his hands were in the air. One of the officers involved, however, said the Taser had been deployed as Bent reached for a satchel that was later found with a loaded pistol inside. Another officer told the court that the Taser had been deployed as Bent walked towards the police with his hand in his pocket. After being Tased, Bent was then dragged shirtless from his home by his hair, the judge found. Bent testified that the officer dragging him said, “I should have f*****g killed you,” before leaving him with another officer in the building’s stairwell. A photograph taken of Bent by his sister, later used as evidence, shows a bald, raw spot where one of his braids had detached from the skin of his scalp. Bent testified that police then asked for access to his vehicle before giving him the chance to speak with a lawyer, at one point threatening to break the windows if he didn’t comply. Police, meanwhile, have insisted that Brent told officers where they could find the keys without coercion. Nothing was found during a police search of the vehicle. Bent did, however, did admit that he threw a guitar case from his 37th floor balcony. Court documents say that a gun was later found inside that case. Police ultimately charged Bent with one count each of possession of a loaded prohibited firearm and possession of a non-restricted firearm without a licence, along with two counts of possession of a prohibited device, namely an over-capacity magazine. 'False and misleading' In examining the testimonies given by the officers on what led them to Taser Bent, the judge found one of the officer’s accounts “impossible to accept.” She ruled that his testimony that Brent had reached for a satchel contradicted not only the accounts of other officers present but his own. In a report made prior to giving his testimony, the officer had stated Bent had dropped his hands and made no mention of a satchel. In that report, the officer had checked ‘yes’ under ‘Subject Confirmed Armed.’ Bent was not found to be armed. “In my view, [the officer] completed the CEW Report in a manner that would avoid questioning of his use of a Taser.” The judge also took issue with the testimony of three other officers who said they did not recall if Bent had been shirtless at the time of the raid or not. “In my view, the officers’ subsequent attempt to justify the use of force by different after-the-fact explanations belies any good faith belief in the necessity of using force at the time,” she wrote.   \n",

More than 100 residents were evacuated from the Tyndall Seniors Village in Mississauga, Mississauga . The flooding began after torrential rains on Tuesday caused the nearby Etobicoke Creek to overflow .

The former public safety minister is calling for the creation of \"protective zones\" around political constituency offices to shield members of Parliament and their staff from a rising tide of threatening behaviour . \"We need as Canadians to open our eyes and recognize that political violence is not something that just occurs somewhere else, but that it is happening here in our own communities,\" he says . The Toronto Liberal MP says the government needs to press social media companies to do more to ensure online spaces are free of invective and harassment . He also acknowledges \"politicians need to look in the mirror themselves\" to raise the bar of political debate, but says the trends are all moving in the wrong direction .   \n",

The storm, which dumped a month's worth of rain on the city in a matter of hours, overwhelmed sewer systems and waterways, causing damage and hampering transit. While such storms are rare, they are not unheard of. Another storm about a decade ago in 2013 caused major flooding, submerging vehicles and necessitating the rescue of passengers from a half-submerged GO Train. With more adverse weather expected due to climate change, the city has undertaken flood mitigation work over the past decade, including a massive project to reroute the mouth of the Don River to add flood protection in the Port Lands – a project which marked a major milestone just last week and which is expected to be compete by the end of this year. But the fact that the city has undertaken flood protection work over the past few years left some wondering why the city was then so overwhelmed by Tuesday's storm. Speaking on CTV Your Morning Wednesday, Mayor Olivia Chow said flood mitigation is at various stages of work in areas across the city, including a massive project to reroute the mouth of the Don River to add flood protection in the Port Lands – a project which marked a major milestone just last week and which is expected to be compete by the end of this year. But the fact that the city has undertaken flood protection work over the past few years left some wondering why the city was then so overwhelmed by Tuesday's storm. Speaking on CTV Your Morning Wednesday, Mayor Olivia Chow said flood mitigation is at various stages of work in areas across the city, with some projects still waiting for dollars to flow. \"The west area, still some of those homeowners can't even get insurance for their basements because they've been flooding so much,\" Chow said. \"So we're waiting for the federal government to join us to really do flood mitigation measures in the west end of the city. It's about $300 million, and they've said yes, it's just we're waiting for the funds to flow.\" Chow said the city also has \"very, very aggressive\" plans to build more housing in the East Harbour area, east of the Don River, but is also waiting on about $200 million from the federal government for flood protection. However she did note that Ottawa has contributed in a \"big\" way to flood protection with the project to naturalize the mouth of the Don River. One of the massive concrete \"plugs\" separating the newly-created stretch of river was removed last week. Once all of the plugs have been removed, the river will flow out through the new mouth, instead of emptying into the narrow Keating Channel. \"The last plug about to be pulled out in the next couple of months, that will allow the Don River to flow into Lake Ontario, and that would ease a lot of the flooding,\" Chow said. \"So it's happening, but we're almost there.\" In a post, Waterfront Toronto confirmed that while a small amount of water from the Don River entered the new stretch of river, the project was not at a stage of completion that would have allowed water to flow through to the new mouth Tuesday. \"A small notch was also recently made at the west end of the North Plug to allow for construction of the riverbank where it meets the wall. Some water and debris flowed into the new river here, and the water level was a little higher than usual,\" Waterfront Toronto said in its post. \"Otherwise, the storm did not impact the construction site and increased waters from the Don River were still moving by way of the Keating Channel.\" However the organization also noted that the river will flow out through the new mouth, instead of emptying into the narrow Keating Channel. \"The last plug about to be pulled out in the next couple of months, that would ease a lot of the flooding,\" Chow said. \"So huge amounts of rain and the system, the system, the city infrastructure, couldn't take it. It was not at a stage of completion that would have allowed water to flow through to the new mouth Tuesday.   \n",

Ontario's government has not yet acted on a bill to declare intimate partner violence an epidemic . An Alberta program offers men counselling, a 24-hour telephone support line, online resources and toolkits . The government says it spent more than $350 million in the last fiscal year on services to address and prevent gender-based violence, including $10 million in violence-prevention initiatives . An inquest into the deaths of three women at the hands of their former partner in 2015 made 86 recommendations aimed at preventing similar tragedies . A provincial strategy to end it must include supports for men at risk of becoming perpetrators, experts tell a committee .   \n",

Jennie Carignan was a little emotional on Thursday as she spoke to reporters about what it means to take over command of the Canadian Armed Forces. It's an honour that felt like the natural next step in her career, she said, something she's worked toward for the last 38 years. It also means, for other women or marginalized people, that \"it's possible, folks — the door is open.\" \"This is actually what my parents used to tell me: 'Anything is possible. You can do anything,'\" she said. \"But I realized in 1986 that that was not necessarily true for everybody. Even if the doors were open, perceptions stay. There's unconscious biases that, frankly, I do have to question, myself, regularly.\" Carignan became chief of the defence staff in a ceremony at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa on Thursday morning, taking over from Gen. Wayne Eyre, who is set to retire after three years in the job. \"I feel ready, poised and supported to take on this manifold challenge,\" Carignan said at the ceremony, with dignitaries including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Gov. Gen. Mary Simon looking on. \"So I embark on my tenure as your chief of the defence staff in a ceremony at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa on Thursday morning, taking over from Gen. Wayne Eyre, who is set to retire after three years in the job. \"I feel ready, poised and supported to take on this manifold challenge,\" Carignan said at the ceremony, with dignitaries including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Gov. Gen. Mary Simon looking on. \"So I embark on my tenure as your chief of defence staff with confidence. Confidence in our team, in our partners and in Canadians. We've got this,\" she said. There are some big challenges ahead for the Armed Forces and its new leader. Carignan said her first priority is recruiting more Canadians to join the military, and keeping existing troops in uniform. There are more than 16,000 vacant positions in the military, with shortfalls throughout its various ranks and professions. At the same time, more than 70,000 people applied to join the Armed Forces in the last year — but just over 4,300 actually got in. The government's defence policy says modernized recruitment processes are aimed at rebuilding the military by 2032. Carignan said she will start gathering her team to figure out how to make that happen faster. \"Recruiting personnel is a complex affair,\" she said. \"If we can get the momentum and get more people in, then sometimes it has a contagious effect.\" For the last three years, Carignan led the office of professional conduct and culture, which was created as a result of the sexual misconduct scandal in 2021. Culture change is still \"at the heart of everything we do,\" she said, adding that in 2021, her office set a course to create \"irreversible change\" over five years. Carignan said she believes the military is still well on track to meet that target. \"We will always deal with misconduct, but it's how we navigate,\" she said. There are shortfalls throughout its various ranks and professions. At the same time, more than 70,000 people applied to join the Armed Forces in the last year — but just over 4,300 actually got in.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who is riding high in the polls, would not commit to the alliance's spending target, saying he doesn't make promises he can't keep. Trudeau faced a push from provincial leaders to speed up the spending timeline during a premiers' meeting in Halifax earlier Wednesday. Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew expressed concerns that failing to meet the target could jeopardize Canada's trading relationship with the U.S., particularly if there is a change in administration. Outside the Republican convention, there was little empathy for Canada's defence spending delay. Trump supporter Amy Lee said she supports the defensive alliance, but members must meet their commitments. Trump supporter Amy Lee said she supports the defensive alliance, but members must meet their commitments. \"Trudeau, we need you to pay your fair share to NATO,\" Lee said. All member countries directly contribute to the alliance's operations at an agreed-upon formula, and Canada pays its required share of that. Canada is one of about a dozen members that are not reaching the two per cent of GDP threshold for defence spending, though only seven members, including the U.S., spend more than Canada in real dollars. Top diplomats from around the world are at the convention to make inroads ahead of a possible second Trump presidency and to push Republicans away from some pledges the former president has made about defence alliances and trade. Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., said some Republicans have an isolationist bent. Many others, she said, understand that “America cannot be strong without having strong alliances.” “There is no singular voice on foreign policy as it relates to a number of issues at this point in the Republican Party,\" Hillman said in Milwaukee. Trump isn't officially scheduled to speak at the convention until Thursday, but has appeared each night of the convention, his right ear covered in a white bandage after it was pierced by a bullet when a man with an assault weapon fired from a rooftop near a rally Saturday afternoon. A rally attendee was killed and two others critically injured, before the gunman was shot dead by a member of the Secret Service. Wednesday was the first opportunity for Trump's running mate JD Vance to introduce himself to the world and he used his time to praise the former president, criticize Biden's foreign policy and highlight how disagreements can make the Republican party stronger. \"We will make sure our allies share in the burden of securing world peace. No more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Vance said. The 39-year-old Ohio senator has built a reputation during his short time in politics for fighting against current U.S. foreign policy and aid to Ukraine. Vance argued against further funding to the war-ravaged country in a column for the New York Times in April, and told the Munich Security Conference earlier this year that he was there to deliver a \"wake-up call\" that America's interests must come first. Trudeau has been one of the most outspoken NATO leaders in support of Ukraine, including at last week's leaders' summit. Vans with screens on the side of the podium   \n",

Silk brand almond milk, coconut milk, almond-coconut milk and oat milk, as well as Great Value brand almond milk, were recalled earlier this month. \"At this point in time, the Ministry of Health can confirm that 2 deaths in Ontario have been related to this outbreak,\" a spokesperson told CP24 in an email. \"The Ministry of Health is working closely with Local Public Health Agencies, Public Health Ontario, the CFIA, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada regarding the recall of these products.\" At least 12 lab-confirmed cases of listeriosis have been reported in connection with the recall, including 10 in Ontario and one each in Quebec and Nova Scotia. All of the affected products, of which there are 18, include the product code 7825 and best-before dates up to and including Oct. 4. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), products contaminated with listeria may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick and include symptoms like vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness. “Pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, the infection can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth. In severe cases of illness, people may die,” PHAC said in the recall. READ MORE: What is listeriosis, the illness recently linked to a recall of plant-based milks? Of the reported listeriosis cases in Canada, 67 per cent were reported in women and the ages of those hospitalized are between 37 and 89. PHAC said the people who became sick developed symptoms between August 2023 and early July 2024. Health officials warned that more infections may continue to be reported as the illness reporting period for this outbreak is between nine and 35 days. In a statement issued Wednesday, the president of Danone Canada, Frédéric Guichard, said all 15 of the Silk products have been removed from shelves across the country. \"The news in this notice is devastating and our most sincere sympathies go out to the families and loved ones during this difficult time,” he said. It’s unclear if the three Great Value products, which are produced by Walmart, are still on the shelves. If you believe you have one of the affected products in your home, PHAC advises to throw the items out or return them to where they were purchased.</td>\n",

The storm, which dumped a month's worth of rain on the city in a matter of hours, overwhelmed sewer systems and waterways, causing damage and hampering transit. While such storms are rare, they are not unheard of. Another storm about a decade ago in 2013 caused major flooding, submerging vehicles and necessitating the rescue of passengers from a half-submerged GO Train. With more adverse weather expected due to climate change, the city has undertaken flood mitigation work over the past decade, including a massive project to reroute the mouth of the Don River to add flood protection in the Port Lands – a project which marked a major milestone just last week and which is expected to be compete by the end of this year. But the fact that the city has undertaken flood protection work over the past few years left some wondering why the city was then so overwhelmed by Tuesday's storm. Speaking on CTV Your Morning Wednesday, Mayor Olivia Chow said flood mitigation is at various stages of work in areas across the city, with some projects still waiting for dollars to flow. \"The west area, still some of those homeowners can't even get insurance for their basements because they've been flooding so much,\" Chow said. \"So we're waiting for the federal government to join us to really do flood mitigation measures in the west end of the city. It's about $300 million, and they've said yes, it's just we're waiting for the funds to flow.\" Chow said the city also has \"very, very aggressive\" plans to build more housing in the East Harbour area, east of the Don River, but is also waiting on about $200 million from the federal government for flood protection. However she did note that Ottawa has contributed in a \"big\" way to flood protection with the project to naturalize the mouth of the Don River. One of the massive concrete \"plugs\" separating the newly-created stretch of river was removed last week. Once all of the plugs have been removed, the river will flow out through the new mouth, instead of emptying into the narrow Keating Channel. \"The last plug about to be pulled out in the next couple of months, that will allow the Don River to flow into Lake Ontario, and that would ease a lot of the flooding,\" Chow said. \"So it's happening, but we're almost there.\" In a post, Waterfront Toronto confirmed that while a small amount of water from the Don River entered the new stretch of river, the project was not at a stage of completion that would have allowed water to flow through to the new mouth Tuesday. \"A small notch was also recently made at the west end of the North Plug to allow for construction of the riverbank where it meets the wall. Some water and debris flowed into the new river here, and the water level was a little higher than usual,\" Waterfront Toronto said in its post. \"Otherwise, the storm did not impact the construction site and increased waters from the Don River were still moving by way of the Keating Channel.\" However the organization also noted that the project is not meant to protect all areas that were affected by Tuesday's flooding. \"The Port Lands Flood Protection project is designed to protect the Port Lands and portions of Leslieville and South Riverdale in a storm even bigger than yesterday's. It is not designed to mitigate flooding on the Don Valley Parkway, which remains within the Don River flood plain.\" Speaking with CP24 Tuesday, Environment Canada Senior Climatologist Dave Phillips said that while the city might typically see one or two thunderstorms with heavy rain in a month, Tuesday brought three in quick succession and the infrastructure was not designed to cope. \"So huge amounts of rain and the system, the city infrastructure, couldn't take it. It was overworked. He pointed out that Toronto is \"a different city\" than it was about 20 or 30 years ago, with far more concrete surfaces and less green space that could absorb heavy rainfall. Chow reiterated Wednesday that the city has been looking at ways to encourage people not to pave their properties over with nonporous surfaces. \"We want to do more. For big parking lots, if it's just concrete, the water basically just runs off,\" Chow said. \"What we want them to do is have interlocking bricks, so that the water can seep into the ground, rather than just run off and flood everything else.\" Earlier this year, staff proposed a separate tax be added to utility bills as a fixed charge, depending on the size of the paved area on a property.  The move led to cries that Toronto was trying to add a \"rain tax.\" Chow directed staff to take another look following an outcry, but said at the time that it was important to have a plan that supports more green infrastructure, prevents flooding, and keeps water bills low.</td>\n",

Some water and debris flowed into the new river here, and the water level was a little higher than usual,\" Waterfront Toronto said in its post. \"Otherwise, the storm did not impact the construction site and increased waters from the Don River were still moving by way of the Keating Channel.\" However the organization also noted that the river will flow out through the new mouth, instead of emptying into the narrow Keating Channel. \"The last plug about to be pulled out in the next couple of months, that would ease a lot of the flooding,\" Chow said. \"So huge amounts of rain and the system, the system, the city infrastructure, couldn't take it. It was not at a stage of completion that would have allowed water to flow through to the new mouth Tuesday.</td>\n",

The Honda Indy held a press conference at the Exhibition Grounds on Thursday where some of the drivers who will compete in this weekend’s races spoke with reporters. But one of them almost didn’t make it. Lochie Hughes, an Australian driver who competes in the USF Pro 2000 series, told reporters that he nearly missed the event due to the traffic and had to eventually find another way to get to the track. “I am just super happy to be here in Toronto. I got stuck in traffic as well so I actually rented a bike to get here on time and then ran the rest of the way,” he said. “It is cool to just be outside along the water there. It reminds me a little bit of back home in Australia, people outdoors playing tennis.” The westbound lanes of Lake Shore Boulevard West are closed from Strachan Avenue to British Columbia Drive in order to accommodate the annual street race and police have previously warned drivers to expect “significant delays” in the area. Hughes might not have gotten that message but he was nonetheless in good spirits on Thursday as he spoke about his impressions of the city. “There are Smarties here. At our hotel we have Smarties so I feel right at home,” he said. Hughes isn’t the only visitor to Toronto who has had to alter their plans due to the city’s notorious gridloick. Last month former One Direction member Niall Horan made headlines after he posted a video which showed him walking to the Scotiabank Arena for a performance because the city’s traffic was “too bad.” In the video, which was sped up and had The Proclaimer’s “I’m Gonna Be (500 miles)” playing in the background, Horan was seen walking from just west of Yonge Street to an underground entrance of Scotiabank Arena past Bay Street. “In all the years I’ve been playing shows, I don’t think I’ve ever walked into a venue,” Horan said in the video. Hughes is scheduled to compete in two USF Pro 2000 series races this weekend. The main event, the NTT INDYCAR SERIES race, will wrap up a weekend of racing at 1:30 p.m. on Sunday.</td>\n",

The 450 grocery stores that are licensed to sell alcohol in Ontario are permitted to order ready-to-drink beverages and larger packs of beer as of today, meaning that the beverages could start showing up on some store shelves relatively soon. The province had previously set a date of August 1 to allow grocery stores to sell ready-to-drink cocktails but announced earlier this week that it was moving up the timeline. Ready-to-drink beverages have been at the forefront of the LCBO strike, with the Ontario Public Service Employees Union previously identifying it as a key issue for his members. Premier Doug Ford, for his part, has said that he is unwilling to budge when it comes to its government’s plans to allow grocers to sell ready-to-drink cocktails. “If they want to negotiate over RTD (Ready-To-Drink beverages), the deal is off,” Ford told reporters at a news conference in Etobicoke last week. “Let me be very clear. It is done, it is gone. That ship has sailed. It’s halfway across Lake Ontario.” LCBO outlets across Ontario have been shuttered since talks broke down and about 9.000 OPSEU members walked off the job on July 5. Talks between the union and the province resumed on Wednesday and are continuing today, OPSEU has told CTV News Toronto. Meanwhile, the province continues to move ahead with its plans to expand the sale of some alcoholic beverages. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance told CP24.com earlier this week that the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario has issued licenses to 3,153 convenience stores to sell beer, wine, cider and ready-to-drink beverages since applications first opened on June 17. An additional 54 grocery stores have also been issued licenses. “In less than two months, on September 5, the Ontario marketplace will hit a new milestone with all eligible convenience stores able to sell beer, cider, wine, and ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages. As the first segment of the market to be expanded, we are pleased that so many convenience stores are gearing up to provide people with more choice,” Colin Blachar said. “As the province implements its plan, the government will continue to constantly evaluate how it can deliver choice and convenience.” The Ontario government has previously indicated that the LCBO will retain the exclusive right to sell spirits in Ontario, even as it allows more retailers to sell other alcoholic beverages.</td>\n",

York Regional Police (YRP) launched an investigation into the trafficking of controlled substances in Vaughan in May. On July 11, police executed a search warrant at a home near Highway 7 and Woodstream Boulevard, east of Martin Grove Road. Police say that officers recovered an “abundance” of prescription drugs that have not been approved by regulatory authorities for “safety, efficacy and quality or for sale in Canada.” The drugs include anabolic steroids, hormone receptors, testosterone replacements, synthetic steroids, erectile dysfunction medications, and opiates. Police said they also seized a quantity of pills they believe to be MDMA as well as two fraudulently registered motor vehicles. Two Vaughan residents have been charged. Jamal Hassan, 29 and Ashley Cunningham, 34, are both facing drug-related charges. “York Regional Police is reminding the public that prescription drugs being sold on the illegal market are often imported from overseas and do not have the same stringent safety regulations as Health Canada,” police said in a news release. “No prescription drugs should be purchased from unlicensed sources, as they may not contain the product that is being advertised. This includes unknown ingredients, incorrect dosages and contamination. Consuming these products can lead to serious health consequences, including hospitalization or even death. Always use legitimate channels to obtain prescription medications safely.” Police continue to investigate and are asking anyone with information to contact investigators.</td>\n",

The area was particularly hit hard by Tuesday’s rainfall and the water levels in Kunsang’s basement reached knee-high height, destroying furniture and toppling over large appliances as the storm surged. “This place, it was like a movie. When this happens to your own house, your brain stops working,” he said. Toronto flooding: Pictures, videos show heavy rainfall in downtown core Eric Swanson lives nearby and saw at least a foot of water in his home’s lower level, despite installing a pressure-sealing door and powered backwater valve in the basement. “Do we call insurance? Do we not call insurance? The mould and the disgustingness of the water and all those issues…I need to get this properly cleaned and taken care of so that my house is still livable,” Swanson said. Homes weren’t the only things damaged in the record-breaking storm, which saw nearly 100 millimetres of rainfall in just a few hours. Several vehicles were also abandoned by their drivers after water gushed onto major roadways across the city, including the Don Valley Parkway where 14 people needed to be rescued. The torrential downpour is already being compared to Toronto’s 2013 storm – listed as one of the most expensive natural disasters in Canada, according to insurance payouts. Data from the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) shows that claims filed in the aftermath of that weather event reached $1 billion. While it’s too early to put a dollar figure on the damage left it the aftermath of Tuesday’s storm, the IBC told CTV News Toronto that the two events are “similar.” “We can’t determine, at this point, what the magnitude of this event is,” Anne Marie Thomas, IBC’s director of consumer and industry relations, said. “We can’t say what this event will cost because, as you can imagine, not everyone has filed an insurance claim yet.” Insurance tips for flooded house, car If your basement was flooded or you needed to abandon your vehicle, the first thing you should do is reach out to you insurer or insurance broker to check your coverage. “Not all [insurance] policies have coverage for weather events like this one,” Thomas said, adding that sewer backup coverage and overland flood coverage would be needed in the case of home insurance, both of which are optional and not always included in basic policies. “A typical homeowner's insurance policy doesn't cover damage caused by sewer backup or flood. It only covers [damage] caused by a burst pipe or something like that in your home,” she said. After you’ve determined what type of coverage you have, the next step is making an inventory of all the damaged items, including taking pictures and videos of those items. If you have proof of purchase, such as a receipt, for an item you’re looking to make a claim for, that will assist in the process. One important note is to hold on to any damaged items before you dispose of them, because, as Thomas explains, the insurance adjuster will want to see the damage as it was at the time of the event. “So if your house is damaged, and you go, ‘OK, I'm just gonna get rid of this.’ Wait until your insurance company says it's okay. Unless that item is posing a health hazard or is a danger,” she said. READ MORE: What to know about insurance claims after Tuesday's flash flooding in Ontario As well, if you rented any equipment to dry out your home, such as a shop vac or industrial fan, keep those receipts as you could be reimbursed. In terms of vehicle insurance for owners who were forced to ditch their vehicle amid the flooding, much like home insurance, only certain policies will cover the damage. “In order for those vehicles to be covered by insurance, the owner of the vehicle would have to have purchased collision or comprehensive coverage or ‘all perils’ coverage,” Thomas said. “Those are the optional physical damage coverages that you can buy for your car. If you have that, then your insurance company would pay to either fix the vehicle or write off your vehicle.” Typically, following a storm like the one on Tuesday, Thomas said the full “realization” of the damage isn’t known until 30 to 45 days after the event.</td>\n",

The North York Harvest Food Bank says it suffered around $50,000 in lost food and damage from the flooding, hampering its ability to provide to those in need. Natasha Bowes, director of development and marketing for the food bank, told CP24 Thursday that the rain overwhelmed their systems. \"It ended up backing up onto our loading docks. We were trying to rescue the food. The power went out,\" she said. The organization tried to transport some of the food to a cold storage facility, but much of it was lost. \"Then while we were trying to save the food that we had in the fridges, we ended up damaging one of our trucks. There was some water damage. So just things built, one over another. Our freezer is already broken. So we're really calling out for the community to help us right now.\" The food bank issued an urgent appeal after the damage. \"Our loading bays are flooded, our freezer is broken, and water is pouring into our warehouse,\" the group said on its website. \"The power outage caused us to lose a significant amount of refrigerated food, including milk, cheese, meat, and nutritious kids snacks intended to nourish our community.\" They are calling for cash donations to help with the recovery, as well as canned goods. \"They can drop it off at their local fire stations. We have donation boxes at grocery stores across North York, and also here at 116 Industry Street,\" Bowes said. She pointed out that the food bank has seen a high level of usage in the community recently, so the timing is difficult. \"The cost of food, inflation, rent in Toronto is just absolutely insane – so the amount of people that are coming, it was a record month for us,\" Bowes said. \"We've never seen this many people come through the doors and it just keeps going up and up.\"</td>\n",

Urbanation Inc. says that just 3,159 new condo units were sold in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area during the first half of the year, representing a 57 per cent decline from the same time period one year prior and a 72 per cent drop as compared to the 10-year average. Urbanation says that it was also the slowest first half for new condo sales since 1997. “With condo prices still near record highs and only a modest 25 basis point decline in interest rates in June from their 22-year high, buyers remained cautious in anticipation of further rate cuts and amidst a burgeoning supply of units for sale,” Urbanation President Shaun Hildebrand said in a news release. “The continued weakening in condo market conditions during the second quarter of 2024 is likely to cause more projects that were slated to launch this year to remain on hold, while others that are struggling to meet sales thresholds for construction financing may ultimately be pulled from the market.” Urbanation says that the total number of unsold condo units in the GTHA has now reached a record high of 25,89, which equates to about 34 months of supply. That is approximately 10,000 more units than the long-term average, the group points out. However, despite the surplus prices have remained relatively stable. Urbanation says that the average asking price for unsold units declined just 2.6 per cent over the past year and by only 4.5 per cent over the past two years. “This demonstrates how sticky new condominium prices have become due to high development and financing costs, and record prices paid for land at the market peak,” the release notes. The GTA’s real estate market has faced significant headwinds over the last two years due to a significant increase in the price of borrowing. In June the average selling price of a home in the Greater Toronto Area across all property types was $1,162,167. That is down from a peak of $1,334,062 in February 2022, which was the prior to the Bank of Canada beginning its interest rate hiking cycle.</td>\n",

In an Ontario Superior Court decision released last month, Justice Sandra Nishikawa handed Omary Bent, 27, a stay of proceedings. He was acquitted of four firearm charges laid on him in the summer of 2021. The acquittal was granted, in part, after Nishikawa found that the officers used excessive force in dragging Bent out of his Etobicoke condominium by his hair and breached his right to counsel in questioning him without a lawyer present. In turn, the judge found the court should “distance itself” from the evidence obtained during the raid. Download our app to get alerts on your device Get the latest local updates right to your inbox According to court documents, the Toronto Police Service (TPS) began looking into Bent after it was suggested by a confidential source that he’d been dealing drugs and possessed a firearm. Police raided Brent’s home on July 27, 2021, deploying a Taser on him within minutes. According to Bent, he was hit with the energy weapon while his hands were in the air. One of the officers involved, however, said the Taser had been deployed as Bent reached for a satchel that was later found with a loaded pistol inside. Another officer told the court that the Taser had been deployed as Bent walked towards the police with his hand in his pocket. After being Tased, Bent was then dragged shirtless from his home by his hair, the judge found. Bent testified that the officer dragging him said, “I should have f*****g killed you,” before leaving him with another officer in the building’s stairwell. A photograph taken of Bent by his sister, later used as evidence, shows a bald, raw spot where one of his braids had detached from the skin of his scalp. Bent testified that police then asked for access to his vehicle before giving him the chance to speak with a lawyer, at one point threatening to break the windows if he didn’t comply. Police, meanwhile, have insisted that Brent told officers where they could find the keys without coercion. Nothing was found during a police search of the vehicle. Bent did, however, did admit that he threw a guitar case from his 37th floor balcony. Court documents say that a gun was later found inside that case. Police ultimately charged Bent with one count each of possession of a loaded prohibited firearm and possession of a non-restricted firearm without a licence, along with two counts of possession of a prohibited device, namely an over-capacity magazine. 'False and misleading' In examining the testimonies given by the officers on what led them to Taser Bent, the judge found one of the officer’s accounts “impossible to accept.” She ruled that his testimony that Brent had reached for a satchel contradicted not only the accounts of other officers present but his own. In a report made prior to giving his testimony, the officer had stated Bent had dropped his hands and made no mention of a satchel. In that report, the officer had checked ‘yes’ under ‘Subject Confirmed Armed.’ Bent was not found to be armed. “In this case, checking “yes” [...] was false and misleading,” the judge wrote in her decision. “In my view, [the officer] completed the CEW Report in a manner that would avoid questioning of his use of a Taser.” The judge also took issue with the testimony of three other officers who said they did not recall if Bent had been shirtless at the time of the raid or not. The judge found their accounts inaccurate and described them as an effort to suggest Bent may have had a hidden weapon. “In my view, the officers’ subsequent attempt to justify the use of force by different after-the-fact explanations belies any good faith belief in the necessity of using force at the time,” she wrote. Ultimately, Nishikawa ruled that the deployment of the Taser constituted an excessive use of force and in turn, violated Bent’s Charter rights. The request made by officers for Bent to hand over his keys before speaking to a lawyer was also deemed a breach of rights. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for the Toronto Police Service said that an adverse comment made by a judge cannot be taken as a definitive ruling on officer conduct. “It is important to understand that negative judicial comments do not necessarily constitute misconduct,” Stephanie Sayer wrote in an email to CTV News Toronto. “When officers are testifying in court, they are not the ones on trial. Like any witness, the officers are not parties to the proceeding – they have no right to representation, no ability to call witnesses or make submissions, no right to make legal arguments, etc. They are there to answer the questions posed to them.” In this case, Sayer said the Crown had reviewed the officers’ testimony and found no evidence of misconduct. Still, she said the service’s Professional Standards Unit was investigating the allegations. Case does damage to trust in policing: Lawyer Bent’s lawyers, Hilary Dudding and Maxime Bédard, told CTV News Toronto that the case serves as an important lesson in public trust in policing. “It's so important that the public feel confident in the police and feel that the police are going to be enforcing laws fairly and within the boundary of the law themselves,” Dudding said. “Even one case like this does damage to the trust that the community has in the police service.” “Police are like every other group of people,” she continued. “There's always going to be frailty there, but looking at a system that takes this more seriously and provides some accountability to the public when this happens is really, really important.” Dudding added that it shouldn’t be left up to individuals to face off against the authorities in court, and put forth the idea of a public oversight body tasked with reviewing these kinds of claims more strenuously. “When an internal process takes place, one wonders how many of these complaints are reviewed or how seriously they're taken, and what the consequences are,” she continued. “We’d all benefit from a more strenuous approach to these things, because we need to focus on the issues that really matter in court, as opposed to trying to figure out what really happened during an engagement with the police.” In unrelated proceedings, Bent is facing a charge of second-degree murder in connection with the stabbing of 24-year-old Shacquan Harrison . He is scheduled to stand trial in late 2024 or early 2025.</td>\n",

The operation that unfolded over the course of 12 hours on Tuesday following torrential rains eventually saw more than 100 residents safely moved out of the nursing home, some by raft and others on foot once the water receded. Mississauga Fire Captain Dan Herd said the evacuation of the Tyndall Seniors Village, which saw multiple emergency services from across the Greater Toronto Area come together, was on a scale he hadn't seen before. \"There was water inside the building, the first floor – in between probably three to four feet high on the walls – and some windows were broken, damaged,” Herd said, adding that the parking lot was inundated by water at one point. \"We set up an instant action plan, and we started to move thousands of litres of water at a time ... the water rescue team was using their rescue boats to assist the removal of ambulatory patients and occupants.\" The flooding began after incredibly heavy rains on Tuesday caused the nearby Etobicoke Creek to overflow, Herd said. Once enough floodwater had been pumped out of the home, some residents were able to walk out of the building, he said. Those who were unable to walk were carried down stairs and out of the building by first responders using lifting equipment, Herd said. \"This is my first personal experience of something to this size,” he said of the operation. None of the residents were injured, said Tom Kukolic, acting deputy chief for Peel Region's paramedics service. Once first responders determined that none of the 116 residents needed emergency care, efforts then shifted to a \"safe extrication and relocation\" operation, Kukolic said, with residents eventually taken to two long-term care homes and two hotels. \"Once the paramedics and firefighters were able to bring the residents out of the home and move them to the triage area, we then had assistance from Peel Wheel-Trans, Toronto TTC Wheel-Trans, and Mississauga Transit,” Kukolic said. The relocation effort was “a seamless transition” thanks to the collaboration of several emergency response teams, including York Region and Toronto paramedics, he said. “Extricating people, it’s very difficult. It is very laborious work ... however, what we do from a paramedic practice perspective, is ensure that we have enough people to safely move residents,\" Kukolic said. Tuesday's massive downpour caused chaos across Toronto and its surrounding communities, with flooding shutting down several major routes and terminals and knocking out power to thousands. Mississauga Fire Chief Deryn Rizzi called the response at the nursing home “a great example” of how multiple agencies across the Greater Toronto Area can work together. \"We are there to work collaboratively together, to address the incident to achieve a common goal, which in this case, it was to evacuate the residents safely,\" he said. For Kukolic, the full-day operation showed how preparation can help first responders deal with large-scale responses triggered by sudden events such as Tuesday's flooding. \"I was proud to be a member of paramedic services and a first responder,” he said. \"It was really great to see how everybody came together to ensure that our most vulnerable were taken care of.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 18, 2024.</td>\n",

A city spokesperson said three wastewater plants were “ bypassing ,” a process in which stormwater and sewage are diverted from a secondary treatment procedure. IN PHOTOS: A look back at the massive flooding across Toronto “The bypassed wastewater still goes through screening, grit removal, primary treatment, phosphorous removal and full disinfection to ensure the treated water always meets strict federal and provincial regulations,” the spokesperson said, adding that the process is done to protect the plants’ ability to continue treating wastewater during an extreme rainstorm. Health officials have advised against swimming in Lake Ontario for 48 hours after rainfall due to the possible presence of high levels of bacteria. On Wednesday, all of Toronto’s beaches were under a red flag. The 10 beaches were marked unsafe for swimming due to high levels of E.coli in the water. “Much of the sewage that may have been deposited after the storm should be disinfected through exposure to UV through the sunlight. It can be unsafe to swim, even at designated swimming beaches, for up to 48 hours after a major rainfall,” the city said. “Storms increase bacteria in the lake, and 48 hours is long enough for bacteria levels in the lake water to drop or dissipate to ensure that the beach water is again safe enough for swimming.” On Tuesday, thunderstorms brought heavy rainfall within three hours, causing widespread flooding across the city. According to Environment Canada, 97.6 millimetres of rain fell, which is more than a month’s worth of precipitation . In July, Toronto usually receives around 75 millimetres of rain.</td>\n",

The former minister's comments come as the attempted assassination of ex-U.S. president Donald Trump prompts renewed concern and discussion about the safety of Canadian politicians. \"We have to take parliamentary security more seriously,\" Mendicino said. \"We need as Canadians to open our eyes and recognize that political violence is not something that just occurs somewhere else, but that it is happening here in our own communities.\" People have constitutional rights to express a point of view and disagree with fellow Canadians including parliamentarians, he said. \"But it's also true that we're seeing more threats, more intimidation, more harassment, which can lead to harm both online and in the community.\" In the last few years, several MPs from different parties have had their constituency offices targeted, including graffiti spray-painted on the exterior and rocks thrown through windows. Mendicino says he has received \"a barrage of death threats\" and that his family has also been targeted. A man recently spat on the MP in Ottawa as he walked to his office. He and his constituency staff have become more prudent about booking appointments with members of the public, devoting more effort to vetting and screening. Housing Minister Sean Fraser says he, too, has received death threats. \"My home has been outfitted with a greater degree of security than I feel is ordinary or that I'm personally even comfortable with,\" he said in an interview. \"But when security officials tell you they need to make certain decisions in your best interest when it comes to personal safety and security, you listen to them.\" Police have provided more protection to federal politicians from various parties in recent years. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said this week he worries about his family's safety, and that he had sought protection in response to menacing behaviour. Mendicino, who was minister responsible for the national police force from October 2021 to July last year, said he \"always found that the RCMP were prepared to step up.\" \"But it's my view that they continue to need more resources, that local law enforcement needs more resources, and that we should leave all options on the table when it comes to creating new authorities for them\" to help prevent harassment, he added. RCMP commissioner Mike Duheme recently said he wanted the government to look at drafting a new law that would make it easier for police to pursue charges against people who threaten elected officials. However, Justice Minister Arif Virani subsequently suggested existing Criminal Code provisions were sufficient. Mendicino said the government needs to press social media companies to do more to ensure online spaces are free of invective and harassment. He also acknowledges \"politicians need to look in the mirror themselves.\" \"And I don't think it's particularly helpful to point fingers and say one party is more guilty of of engaging in extreme rhetoric than the other. I think we've got a collective responsibility to raise the bar of political debate,\" he said. Overall, he worries \"that the trends are all moving in the wrong direction.\" Unless the problem is taken seriously, it will spur more political violence and make it harder to attract and retain good people in politics, Mendicino added. \"I'm going to continue to speak out on this issue to prevent that from happening.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 18, 2024. — With a file from Alessia Passafiume</td>\n",

The storm, which dumped a month's worth of rain on the city in a matter of hours, overwhelmed sewer systems and waterways, causing damage and hampering transit. While such storms are rare, they are not unheard of. Another storm about a decade ago in 2013 caused major flooding, submerging vehicles and necessitating the rescue of passengers from a half-submerged GO Train. With more adverse weather expected due to climate change, the city has undertaken flood mitigation work over the past decade, including a massive project to reroute the mouth of the Don River to add flood protection in the Port Lands – a project which marked a major milestone just last week and which is expected to be compete by the end of this year. But the fact that the city has undertaken flood protection work over the past few years left some wondering why the city was then so overwhelmed by Tuesday's storm. Speaking on CTV Your Morning Wednesday, Mayor Olivia Chow said flood mitigation is at various stages of work in areas across the city, with some projects still waiting for dollars to flow. \"The west area, still some of those homeowners can't even get insurance for their basements because they've been flooding so much,\" Chow said. \"So we're waiting for the federal government to join us to really do flood mitigation measures in the west end of the city. It's about $300 million, and they've said yes, it's just we're waiting for the funds to flow.\" Chow said the city also has \"very, very aggressive\" plans to build more housing in the East Harbour area, east of the Don River, but is also waiting on about $200 million from the federal government for flood protection. However she did note that Ottawa has contributed in a \"big\" way to flood protection with the project to naturalize the mouth of the Don River. One of the massive concrete \"plugs\" separating the newly-created stretch of river was removed last week. Once all of the plugs have been removed, the river will flow out through the new mouth, instead of emptying into the narrow Keating Channel. \"The last plug about to be pulled out in the next couple of months, that will allow the Don River to flow into Lake Ontario, and that would ease a lot of the flooding,\" Chow said. \"So it's happening, but we're almost there.\" In a post, Waterfront Toronto confirmed that while a small amount of water from the Don River entered the new stretch of river, the project was not at a stage of completion that would have allowed water to flow through to the new mouth Tuesday. \"A small notch was also recently made at the west end of the North Plug to allow for construction of the riverbank where it meets the wall. Some water and debris flowed into the new river here, and the water level was a little higher than usual,\" Waterfront Toronto said in its post. \"Otherwise, the storm did not impact the construction site and increased waters from the Don River were still moving by way of the Keating Channel.\" However the organization also noted that the project is not meant to protect all areas that were affected by Tuesday's flooding. \"The Port Lands Flood Protection project is designed to protect the Port Lands and portions of Leslieville and South Riverdale in a storm even bigger than yesterday's. It is not designed to mitigate flooding on the Don Valley Parkway, which remains within the Don River flood plain.\" Speaking with CP24 Tuesday, Environment Canada Senior Climatologist Dave Phillips said that while the city might typically see one or two thunderstorms with heavy rain in a month, Tuesday brought three in quick succession and the infrastructure was not designed to cope. \"So huge amounts of rain and the system, the city infrastructure, couldn't take it. It was overworked. He pointed out that Toronto is \"a different city\" than it was about 20 or 30 years ago, with far more concrete surfaces and less green space that could absorb heavy rainfall. Chow reiterated Wednesday that the city has been looking at ways to encourage people not to pave their properties over with nonporous surfaces. \"We want to do more. For big parking lots, if it's just concrete, the water basically just runs off,\" Chow said. \"What we want them to do is have interlocking bricks, so that the water can seep into the ground, rather than just run off and flood everything else.\" Earlier this year, staff proposed a separate tax be added to utility bills as a fixed charge, depending on the size of the paved area on a property.  The move led to cries that Toronto was trying to add a \"rain tax.\" Chow directed staff to take another look following an outcry, but said at the time that it was important to have a plan that supports more green infrastructure, prevents flooding, and keeps water bills low.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Thursday, July 18, 2024 5:57AM EDT Any Ontario strategy to end intimate partner violence must include more programs for men at risk of becoming perpetrators, an area in which the province is currently sorely lacking, experts told a committee Wednesday. There is a \"smattering\" of services available, said Katreena Scott, academic director of the Centre for Research and Education on Violence Against Women and Children at Western University, but it is too few and far between. \"The reality in Ontario is that we live, right now, in a system where if there is somebody who is engaging in — or is at risk for — hurtful, abusive or coercive behaviour, it's very, very difficult to find and get help,\" Scott told a legislative committee studying intimate partner violence. \"Really, what has to happen is they need to wait until they're involved in the criminal justice system.\" The Progressive Conservative government said this spring that it would support an NDP bill to declare intimate partner violence an epidemic, but then-government house leader Paul Calandra also tasked the justice committee with a broader study of the issue. Those hearings began Wednesday. The move came nearly a year after the province rejected calls from an inquest into the deaths of three women at the hands of their former partner to make the declaration, saying it couldn't label intimate partner violence an epidemic because it was not an infectious or communicable disease. The jury at a coroner’s inquest into the 2015 deaths of Nathalie Warmerdam, Carol Culleton and Anastasia Kuzyk in Renfrew County made 86 recommendations aimed at preventing similar tragedies. One of those recommendations was to establish a 24-hour hotline for men who need support to prevent them from engaging in such violence, but the government has not yet acted on it. Experts at the legislative committee Wednesday held up an Alberta program as a good example of support for prevention, which offers men counselling, a 24-hour telephone support line, online resources and toolkits. Lana Wells, an associate professor at the University of Calgary and a domestic violence researcher, said men are predominantly the perpetrators of intimate partner violence and a provincial strategy to end it must include supports for them. \"When men and boys can emotionally self-regulate, embody gender-equitable norms and behaviours, have the skills to disrupt sexism, violence within themselves and their peers, embrace non-violence, have the skills to heal, repair and manage conflict, be accountable, and actively inspire their peers, colleagues and children to do the same, then we can stop violence before it starts,\" she told the committee. \"So what can Ontario do to advance this area? I think really focusing on removing the burden from victims and victimology and start to focus our attention on the people and systems that are causing harm.\" Better data is also needed that can speak to prevention, Wells said, as most of the research in this area has focused on victims. There needs to be more information on any patterns that precede domestic violence and what factors can lead people to become perpetrators in order to disrupt those trajectories, she said. The Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services said it spent more than $350 million in the last fiscal year on services to address and prevent gender-based violence, including more than $10 million in violence-prevention initiatives. \"Everyone has the right to live free from fear, exploitation, intimidation, and the threat of violence,\" the ministry wrote in a statement. \"That is why our government is working to prevent intimate partner violence before it occurs.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 17, 2024.</td>\n",

Jennie Carignan was a little emotional on Thursday as she spoke to reporters about what it means to take over command of the Canadian Armed Forces. It's an honour that felt like the natural next step in her career, she said, something she's worked toward for the last 38 years. It also means, for other women or marginalized people, that \"it's possible, folks — the door is open.\" \"This is actually what my parents used to tell me: 'Anything is possible. You can do anything,'\" she said. \"But I realized in 1986 that that was not necessarily true for everybody. Even if the doors were open, perceptions stay. There's unconscious biases that, frankly, I do have to question, myself, regularly.\" Carignan became chief of the defence staff in a ceremony at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa on Thursday morning, taking over from Gen. Wayne Eyre, who is set to retire after three years in the job. \"I feel ready, poised and supported to take on this manifold challenge,\" Carignan said at the ceremony, with dignitaries including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Gov. Gen. Mary Simon looking on. \"So I embark on my tenure as your chief of defence staff with confidence. Confidence in our team, in our partners and in Canadians. We've got this,\" she said. There are some big challenges ahead for the Armed Forces and its new leader. Carignan said her first priority is recruiting more Canadians to join the military, and keeping existing troops in uniform. There are more than 16,000 vacant positions in the military, with shortfalls throughout its various ranks and professions. At the same time, more than 70,000 people applied to join the Armed Forces in the last year — but just over 4,300 actually got in. The government's defence policy says modernized recruitment processes are aimed at rebuilding the military by 2032. Carignan said she will start gathering her team to figure out how to make that happen faster. \"Recruiting personnel is a complex affair,\" she said. \"If we can get the momentum and get more people in, then sometimes it has a contagious effect.\" For the last three years, Carignan led the office of professional conduct and culture, which was created as a result of the sexual misconduct scandal in 2021. Culture change is still \"at the heart of everything we do,\" she said, adding that in 2021, her office set a course to create \"irreversible change\" over five years. Carignan said she believes the military is still well on track to meet that target. \"We will always deal with misconduct, but it's how we navigate,\" she said. There is another five-year timeline she's thinking about, too. Carignan told reporters that based on talks with allies, she believes Canada has about five years to get ready to face a new set of threats — conventional military threats from adversaries like China, Russia and Iran, as well as emerging threats like disinformation. \"I think Canadians need to understand that if we are not ready, we might not be able to react appropriately in defence of them,\" she said. Defence Minister Bill Blair said his government feels a sense of urgency to get the Armed Forces the equipment it needs. His department has pledged to overhaul the notoriously slow and bureaucratic procurement system. \"We have to be ready to meet the moment,\" he said, cautioning that building new ships and planes is not a quick process. In his comments at the ceremony Eyre spoke about \"what could be existential threats,\" and said Canada has a history of being unprepared at the outset of wars. \"The security situation out there is not getting any better and we will continue to face many crises, often stacked one upon the other,\" he said. \"To do our part in the free world, we need to be at our own peak capability and readiness, and thus peak deterrence, to meet that threat.\" Carignan brings \"highly relevant experience\" to her role, Eyre said. He told her in French: \"You are ready for this role, and you deserve it.\" She was the first woman to command a combat unit in the Canadian military, and her career has included deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Syria. Following the formal handover of power, Trudeau thanked Eyre, saying he was \"the exact right person to help lead Canada through incredibly difficult times.\" He praised Carignan as someone of the right calibre to take over, and pointed out she is the first woman to lead the military of any G20 country. \"You've demonstrated time and time again the ability to lead with both strength and flexibility,\" Trudeau said. \"You've shown a tremendous sense of agility, vision and courage.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 18, 2024. — With files from Alessia Passafiume.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Thursday, July 18, 2024 6:28AM EDT Republicans criticized U.S. President Joe Biden's record on foreign policy at the national convention in Milwaukee, as many party faithful called for America to step back from its contributions to the world. Wednesday's agenda and its theme of \"Make America Strong Once Again\" will give leaders around the world insight into the potential impact of a second Donald Trump presidency. \"No NATO. I want America strong,\" said Kimberly Nguyen, wearing a star-spangled dress and draped in a Trump 2024 flag outside the convention. Trump, who was officially confirmed as the Republican presidential candidate on Monday, has mused about increased tariffs, been critical of aid to Ukraine and repeatedly claimed he would not defend NATO members that don't meet defence spending targets, of which Canada is one. During a NATO leaders' summit in Washington last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to meet the spending target, which is the equivalent of two per cent of gross domestic product, by 2032. However, he has been criticized for the lengthy timeline and the lack of detail on how Ottawa will make it happen. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who is riding high in the polls, would not commit to the alliance's spending target, saying he doesn't make promises he can't keep. Trudeau faced a push from provincial leaders to speed up the spending timeline during a premiers' meeting in Halifax earlier Wednesday. Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew expressed concerns that failing to meet the target could jeopardize Canada's trading relationship with the U.S., particularly if there is a change in administration. Outside the Republican convention, there was little empathy for Canada's defence spending delay. Trump supporter Amy Lee said she supports the defensive alliance, but members must meet their commitments. \"Trudeau, we need you to pay your fair share to NATO,\" Lee said. All member countries directly contribute to the alliance's operations at an agreed-upon formula, and Canada pays its required share of that. Canada is one of about a dozen members that are not reaching the two per cent of GDP threshold for defence spending, though only seven members, including the U.S., spend more than Canada in real dollars. Top diplomats from around the world are at the convention to make inroads ahead of a possible second Trump presidency and to push Republicans away from some pledges the former president has made about defence alliances and trade. Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., said some Republicans have an isolationist bent. Many others, she said, understand that “America cannot be strong without having strong alliances.” “There is no singular voice on foreign policy as it relates to a number of issues at this point in the Republican Party,\" Hillman said in Milwaukee. Trump isn't officially scheduled to speak at the convention until Thursday, but has appeared each night of the convention, his right ear covered in a white bandage after it was pierced by a bullet when a man with an assault weapon fired from a rooftop near a rally Saturday afternoon. A rally attendee was killed and two others critically injured, before the gunman was shot dead by a member of the Secret Service. Wednesday was the first opportunity for Trump's running mate JD Vance to introduce himself to the world and he used his time to praise the former president, criticize Biden's foreign policy and highlight how disagreements can make the Republican party stronger. \"We will make sure our allies share in the burden of securing world peace. No more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Vance said. The 39-year-old Ohio senator has built a reputation during his short time in politics for fighting against current U.S. foreign policy and aid to Ukraine. Vance argued against further funding to the war-ravaged country in a column for the New York Times in April, and told the Munich Security Conference earlier this year that he was there to deliver a \"wake-up call\" that America's interests must come first. Trudeau has been one of the most outspoken NATO leaders in support of Ukraine, including at last week's leaders' summit. Vans with screens on the side were driving around the entrances of the convention Wednesday, displaying calls for Republicans to stand with Ukraine. The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, which funded the mobile messaging, said that was intended to remind Republicans that standing with Ukraine helps to defeat America's enemies. Hillman said Vance has some views on international and domestic policy that do not align with \"Canadian values in some circumstances and certainly our government policy in others.\" But, she said, Vance represents Ohio, which has a massive trading relationship with Canada. More than a third of the state's exports go to Canada. “Having someone with that understanding of the importance of the Canada-U.S. economic relationship is a good thing for Canada.” The vice president pick also has a Canadian connection: Jamil Jivani, the recently elected Conservative MP for Durham, has called Vance his best friend from Yale.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who is riding high in the polls, would not commit to the alliance's spending target, saying he doesn't make promises he can't keep. Trudeau faced a push from provincial leaders to speed up the spending timeline during a premiers' meeting in Halifax earlier Wednesday. Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew expressed concerns that failing to meet the target could jeopardize Canada's trading relationship with the U.S., particularly if there is a change in administration. Outside the Republican convention, there was little empathy for Canada's defence spending delay. Trump supporter Amy Lee said she supports the defensive alliance, but members must meet their commitments. Trump supporter Amy Lee said she supports the defensive alliance, but members must meet their commitments. \"Trudeau, we need you to pay your fair share to NATO,\" Lee said. All member countries directly contribute to the alliance's operations at an agreed-upon formula, and Canada pays its required share of that. Canada is one of about a dozen members that are not reaching the two per cent of GDP threshold for defence spending, though only seven members, including the U.S., spend more than Canada in real dollars. Top diplomats from around the world are at the convention to make inroads ahead of a possible second Trump presidency and to push Republicans away from some pledges the former president has made about defence alliances and trade. Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., said some Republicans have an isolationist bent. Many others, she said, understand that “America cannot be strong without having strong alliances.” “There is no singular voice on foreign policy as it relates to a number of issues at this point in the Republican Party,\" Hillman said in Milwaukee.

In a news release on Wednesday , the RCMP announced the result of its investigation into the group, which began in 2023 when they uncovered evidence of \"sophisticated drug networking\" in the Golden Horseshoe. Since April 2024, the RCMP said they have executed several warrants in three rounds, resulting in arrests and seizure of large quantities of crystal methamphetamine, cocaine, fentanyl, and prescription pills. In addition, multiple firearms, ammunition, ballistic vests, Canadian currency and other items allegedly used to help in the trafficking operation were also seized, the RCMP said. \"On top of that, several kilograms of suspicious substances have been sent to the lab to be tested for suspected narcotics,\" Mounties added. Among the 19 people apprehended were the alleged leaders of the group, who the RCMP identified as 41-year-old Sean Bixby, 38-year-old David Langhorn and 43-year-old Dwayne Smith. They are facing dozens of drug trafficking charges. \"Organized crime groups use proceeds of drug trafficking to fund further criminal activity. These arrests make a positive impact for our community by closing off what had been a profitable operation that supported organized crime in southern Ontario,\" said RCMP Insp Henry Tillo, who is the officer-in-charge of Golden Horseshoe Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit (CFSEU). The unit, comprised of RCMP, Hamilton police, Niagara police, Brantford police, Six Nations police officers and the Canada Border Services Agency, led the investigation into the case.

Silk brand almond milk, coconut milk, almond-coconut milk and oat milk, as well as Great Value brand almond milk, were recalled earlier this month. \\\"At this point in time, the Ministry of Health can confirm that 2 deaths in Ontario have been related to this outbreak,\\\" a spokesperson told CP24 in an email. \\\"The Ministry of Health is working closely with Local Public Health Agencies, Public Health Ontario, the CFIA, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada regarding the recall of these products.\\\" At least 12 lab-confirmed cases of listeriosis have been reported in connection with the recall, including 10 in Ontario and one each in Quebec and Nova Scotia. All of the affected products, of which there are 18, include the product code 7825 and best-before dates up to and including Oct. 4. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), products contaminated with listeria may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick and include symptoms like vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness. \\u201cPregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, the infection can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth. In severe cases of illness, people may die,\\u201d PHAC said in the recall. READ MORE: What is listeriosis, the illness recently linked to a recall of plant-based milks? Of the reported listeriosis cases in Canada, 67 per cent were reported in women and the ages of those hospitalized are between 37 and 89. PHAC said the people who became sick developed symptoms between August 2023 and early July 2024. Health officials warned that more infections may continue to be reported as the illness reporting period for this outbreak is between nine and 35 days. In a statement issued Wednesday, the president of Danone Canada, Fr\\u00e9d\\u00e9ric Guichard, said all 15 of the Silk products have been removed from shelves across the country. \\\"The news in this notice is devastating and our most sincere sympathies go out to the families and loved ones during this difficult time,\\u201d he said. It\\u2019s unclear if the three Great Value products, which are produced by Walmart, are still on the shelves. If you believe you have one of the affected products in your home, PHAC advises to throw the items out or return them to where they were purchased. \",\n          \" Thursday, July 18, 2024 4:08PM EDT Gen. Jennie Carignan was a little emotional on Thursday as she spoke to reporters about what it means to take over command of the Canadian Armed Forces. It's an honour that felt like the natural next step in her career, she said, something she's worked toward for the last 38 years. It also means, for other women or marginalized people, that \\\"it's possible, folks \\u2014 the door is open.\\\" \\\"This is actually what my parents used to tell me: 'Anything is possible. You can do anything,'\\\" she said. \\\"But I realized in 1986 that that was not necessarily true for everybody. Even if the doors were open, perceptions stay. There's unconscious biases that, frankly, I do have to question, myself, regularly.\\\" Carignan became chief of the defence staff in a ceremony at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa on Thursday morning, taking over from Gen. Wayne Eyre, who is set to retire after three years in the job. \\\"I feel ready, poised and supported to take on this manifold challenge,\\\" Carignan said at the ceremony, with dignitaries including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Gov. Gen. Mary Simon looking on. \\\"So I embark on my tenure as your chief of defence staff with confidence. Confidence in our team, in our partners and in Canadians. We've got this,\\\" she said. There are some big challenges ahead for the Armed Forces and its new leader. Carignan said her first priority is recruiting more Canadians to join the military, and keeping existing troops in uniform. There are more than 16,000 vacant positions in the military, with shortfalls throughout its various ranks and professions. At the same time, more than 70,000 people applied to join the Armed Forces in the last year \\u2014 but just over 4,300 actually got in. The government's defence policy says modernized recruitment processes are aimed at rebuilding the military by 2032. Carignan said she will start gathering her team to figure out how to make that happen faster. \\\"Recruiting personnel is a complex affair,\\\" she said. \\\"If we can get the momentum and get more people in, then sometimes it has a contagious effect.\\\" For the last three years, Carignan led the office of professional conduct and culture, which was created as a result of the sexual misconduct scandal in 2021. Culture change is still \\\"at the heart of everything we do,\\\" she said, adding that in 2021, her office set a course to create \\\"irreversible change\\\" over five years. Carignan said she believes the military is still well on track to meet that target. \\\"We will always deal with misconduct, but it's how we navigate,\\\" she said. There is another five-year timeline she's thinking about, too. Carignan told reporters that based on talks with allies, she believes Canada has about five years to get ready to face a new set of threats \\u2014 conventional military threats from adversaries like China, Russia and Iran, as well as emerging threats like disinformation. \\\"I think Canadians need to understand that if we are not ready, we might not be able to react appropriately in defence of them,\\\" she said. Defence Minister Bill Blair said his government feels a sense of urgency to get the Armed Forces the equipment it needs. His department has pledged to overhaul the notoriously slow and bureaucratic procurement system. \\\"We have to be ready to meet the moment,\\\" he said, cautioning that building new ships and planes is not a quick process. In his comments at the ceremony Eyre spoke about \\\"what could be existential threats,\\\" and said Canada has a history of being unprepared at the outset of wars. \\\"The security situation out there is not getting any better and we will continue to face many crises, often stacked one upon the other,\\\" he said. \\\"To do our part in the free world, we need to be at our own peak capability and readiness, and thus peak deterrence, to meet that threat.\\\" Carignan brings \\\"highly relevant experience\\\" to her role, Eyre said. He told her in French: \\\"You are ready for this role, and you deserve it.\\\" She was the first woman to command a combat unit in the Canadian military, and her career has included deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Syria. Following the formal handover of power, Trudeau thanked Eyre, saying he was \\\"the exact right person to help lead Canada through incredibly difficult times.\\\" He praised Carignan as someone of the right calibre to take over, and pointed out she is the first woman to lead the military of any G20 country. \\\"You've demonstrated time and time again the ability to lead with both strength and flexibility,\\\" Trudeau said. \\\"You've shown a tremendous sense of agility, vision and courage.\\\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 18, 2024. \\u2014 With files from Alessia Passafiume. \",\n          \" Thursday, July 18, 2024 6:06AM EDT Former public safety minister Marco Mendicino is calling for the creation of \\\"protective zones\\\" around political constituency offices to shield members of Parliament and their staff from a rising tide of threatening behaviour. Mendicino, a Toronto Liberal MP, said under the plan anyone who intimidated or otherwise harassed people within the buffer zone of perhaps 50 to 100 metres would be subject to harsher criminal penalties including jail time. In an interview, Mendicino suggested spelling out such zones in regulations that will flow from the recently passed foreign interference bill, which contains new measures to protect essential infrastructure. The former minister's comments come as the attempted assassination of ex-U.S. president Donald Trump prompts renewed concern and discussion about the safety of Canadian politicians. \\\"We have to take parliamentary security more seriously,\\\" Mendicino said. \\\"We need as Canadians to open our eyes and recognize that political violence is not something that just occurs somewhere else, but that it is happening here in our own communities.\\\" People have constitutional rights to express a point of view and disagree with fellow Canadians including parliamentarians, he said. \\\"But it's also true that we're seeing more threats, more intimidation, more harassment, which can lead to harm both online and in the community.\\\" In the last few years, several MPs from different parties have had their constituency offices targeted, including graffiti spray-painted on the exterior and rocks thrown through windows. Mendicino says he has received \\\"a barrage of death threats\\\" and that his family has also been targeted. A man recently spat on the MP in Ottawa as he walked to his office. He and his constituency staff have become more prudent about booking appointments with members of the public, devoting more effort to vetting and screening. Housing Minister Sean Fraser says he, too, has received death threats. \\\"My home has been outfitted with a greater degree of security than I feel is ordinary or that I'm personally even comfortable with,\\\" he said in an interview. \\\"But when security officials tell you they need to make certain decisions in your best interest when it comes to personal safety and security, you listen to them.\\\" Police have provided more protection to federal politicians from various parties in recent years. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said this week he worries about his family's safety, and that he had sought protection in response to menacing behaviour. Mendicino, who was minister responsible for the national police force from October 2021 to July last year, said he \\\"always found that the RCMP were prepared to step up.\\\" \\\"But it's my view that they continue to need more resources, that local law enforcement needs more resources, and that we should leave all options on the table when it comes to creating new authorities for them\\\" to help prevent harassment, he added. RCMP commissioner Mike Duheme recently said he wanted the government to look at drafting a new law that would make it easier for police to pursue charges against people who threaten elected officials. However, Justice Minister Arif Virani subsequently suggested existing Criminal Code provisions were sufficient. Mendicino said the government needs to press social media companies to do more to ensure online spaces are free of invective and harassment. He also acknowledges \\\"politicians need to look in the mirror themselves.\\\" \\\"And I don't think it's particularly helpful to point fingers and say one party is more guilty of of engaging in extreme rhetoric than the other. I think we've got a collective responsibility to raise the bar of political debate,\\\" he said. Overall, he worries \\\"that the trends are all moving in the wrong direction.\\\" Unless the problem is taken seriously, it will spur more political violence and make it harder to attract and retain good people in politics, Mendicino added. \\\"I'm going to continue to speak out on this issue to prevent that from happening.\\\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 18, 2024. \\u2014 With a file from Alessia Passafiume \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1712,\n        \"min\": 193,\n        \"max\": 6562,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2637,\n          4727,\n          4191\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"total_word\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 292,\n        \"min\": 25,\n        \"max\": 1115,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          436,\n          809,\n          669\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Silk brand almond milk, coconut milk, almond-coconut milk and oat milk were recalled earlier this month .

He also acknowledges \\\"politicians need to look in the mirror themselves\\\" to raise the bar of political debate, but says the trends are all moving in the wrong direction .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"min_word\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 73,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 273,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 19,\n        \"samples\": [\n          104,\n          188,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"max_word\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 73,\n        \"min\": 11,\n        \"max\": 283,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 19,\n        \"samples\": [\n          114,\n          198,\n          11\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"cp24\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.cp24.com/news/two-listeriosis-deaths-in-ontario-linked-to-plant-based-milk-recall-moh-1.6968389\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"news\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"model_used\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"allenai\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "0   Wednesday, July 17, 2024 5:27PM EDT A massive rainstorm which flooded roads, basements and businesses in the city Tuesday is raising questions about Toronto's preparedness when it comes to major weather events. The storm, which dumped a month's worth of rain on the city in a matter of hours, overwhelmed sewer systems and waterways, causing damage and hampering transit. While such storms are rare, they are not unheard of. Another storm about a decade ago in 2013 caused major flooding, submerging vehicles and necessitating the rescue of passengers from a half-submerged GO Train. With more adverse weather expected due to climate change, the city has undertaken flood mitigation work over the past decade, including a massive project to reroute the mouth of the Don River to add flood protection in the Port Lands – a project which marked a major milestone just last week and which is expected to be compete by the end of this year. But the fact that the city has undertaken flood protection work over the past few years left some wondering why the city was then so overwhelmed by Tuesday's storm. Speaking on CTV Your Morning Wednesday, Mayor Olivia Chow said flood mitigation is at various stages of work in areas across the city, with some projects still waiting for dollars to flow. \"The west area, still some of those homeowners can't even get insurance for their basements because they've been flooding so much,\" Chow said. \"So we're waiting for the federal government to join us to really do flood mitigation measures in the west end of the city. It's about $300 million, and they've said yes, it's just we're waiting for the funds to flow.\" Chow said the city also has \"very, very aggressive\" plans to build more housing in the East Harbour area, east of the Don River, but is also waiting on about $200 million from the federal government for flood protection. However she did note that Ottawa has contributed in a \"big\" way to flood protection with the project to naturalize the mouth of the Don River. One of the massive concrete \"plugs\" separating the newly-created stretch of river was removed last week. Once all of the plugs have been removed, the river will flow out through the new mouth, instead of emptying into the narrow Keating Channel. \"The last plug about to be pulled out in the next couple of months, that will allow the Don River to flow into Lake Ontario, and that would ease a lot of the flooding,\" Chow said. \"So it's happening, but we're almost there.\" In a post, Waterfront Toronto confirmed that while a small amount of water from the Don River entered the new stretch of river, the project was not at a stage of completion that would have allowed water to flow through to the new mouth Tuesday. \"A small notch was also recently made at the west end of the North Plug to allow for construction of the riverbank where it meets the wall. Some water and debris flowed into the new river here, and the water level was a little higher than usual,\" Waterfront Toronto said in its post. \"Otherwise, the storm did not impact the construction site and increased waters from the Don River were still moving by way of the Keating Channel.\" However the organization also noted that the project is not meant to protect all areas that were affected by Tuesday's flooding. \"The Port Lands Flood Protection project is designed to protect the Port Lands and portions of Leslieville and South Riverdale in a storm even bigger than yesterday's. It is not designed to mitigate flooding on the Don Valley Parkway, which remains within the Don River flood plain.\" Speaking with CP24 Tuesday, Environment Canada Senior Climatologist Dave Phillips said that while the city might typically see one or two thunderstorms with heavy rain in a month, Tuesday brought three in quick succession and the infrastructure was not designed to cope. \"So huge amounts of rain and the system, the city infrastructure, couldn't take it. It was overworked. He pointed out that Toronto is \"a different city\" than it was about 20 or 30 years ago, with far more concrete surfaces and less green space that could absorb heavy rainfall. Chow reiterated Wednesday that the city has been looking at ways to encourage people not to pave their properties over with nonporous surfaces. \"We want to do more. For big parking lots, if it's just concrete, the water basically just runs off,\" Chow said. \"What we want them to do is have interlocking bricks, so that the water can seep into the ground, rather than just run off and flood everything else.\" Earlier this year, staff proposed a separate tax be added to utility bills as a fixed charge, depending on the size of the paved area on a property.  The move led to cries that Toronto was trying to add a \"rain tax.\" Chow directed staff to take another look following an outcry, but said at the time that it was important to have a plan that supports more green infrastructure, prevents flooding, and keeps water bills low.    \n",

Silk brand almond milk, coconut milk, almond-coconut milk and oat milk, as well as Great Value brand almond milk, were recalled earlier this month. \"At this point in time, the Ministry of Health can confirm that 2 deaths in Ontario have been related to this outbreak,\" a spokesperson told CP24 in an email. \"The Ministry of Health is working closely with Local Public Health Agencies, Public Health Ontario, the CFIA, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada regarding the recall of these products.\" At least 12 lab-confirmed cases of listeriosis have been reported in connection with the recall, including 10 in Ontario and one each in Quebec and Nova Scotia. All of the affected products, of which there are 18, include the product code 7825 and best-before dates up to and including Oct. 4. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), products contaminated with listeria may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick and include symptoms like vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness. “Pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, the infection can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth. In severe cases of illness, people may die,” PHAC said in the recall. READ MORE: What is listeriosis, the illness recently linked to a recall of plant-based milks? Of the reported listeriosis cases in Canada, 67 per cent were reported in women and the ages of those hospitalized are between 37 and 89. PHAC said the people who became sick developed symptoms between August 2023 and early July 2024. Health officials warned that more infections may continue to be reported as the illness reporting period for this outbreak is between nine and 35 days. In a statement issued Wednesday, the president of Danone Canada, Frédéric Guichard, said all 15 of the Silk products have been removed from shelves across the country. \"The news in this notice is devastating and our most sincere sympathies go out to the families and loved ones during this difficult time,” he said. It’s unclear if the three Great Value products, which are produced by Walmart, are still on the shelves. If you believe you have one of the affected products in your home, PHAC advises to throw the items out or return them to where they were purchased.    \n",

              "      <td>Wednesday, July 17, 2024 5:27PM EDT A massive rainstorm which flooded roads, basements and businesses in the city Tuesday is raising questions about Toronto's preparedness when it comes to major weather events. The storm, which dumped a month's worth of rain on the city in a matter of hours, overwhelmed sewer systems and waterways, causing damage and hampering transit. While such storms are rare, they are not unheard of. Another storm about a decade ago in 2013 caused major flooding, submerging vehicles and necessitating the rescue of passengers from a half-submerged GO Train. With more adverse weather expected due to climate change, the city has undertaken flood mitigation work over the past decade, including a massive project to reroute the mouth of the Don River to add flood protection in the Port Lands – a project which marked a major milestone just last week and which is expected to be compete by the end of this year. But the fact that the city has undertaken flood protection work over the past few years left some wondering why the city was then so overwhelmed by Tuesday's storm. Speaking on CTV Your Morning Wednesday, Mayor Olivia Chow said flood mitigation is at various stages of work in areas across the city, with some projects still waiting for dollars to flow. \"The west area, still some of those homeowners can't even get insurance for their basements because they've been flooding so much,\" Chow said. \"So we're waiting for the federal government to join us to really do flood mitigation measures in the west end of the city. It's about $300 million, and they've said yes, it's just we're waiting for the funds to flow.\" Chow said the city also has \"very, very aggressive\" plans to build more housing in the East Harbour area, east of the Don River, but is also waiting on about $200 million from the federal government for flood protection. However she did note that Ottawa has contributed in a \"big\" way to flood protection with the project to naturalize the mouth of the Don River. One of the massive concrete \"plugs\" separating the newly-created stretch of river was removed last week. Once all of the plugs have been removed, the river will flow out through the new mouth, instead of emptying into the narrow Keating Channel. \"The last plug about to be pulled out in the next couple of months, that will allow the Don River to flow into Lake Ontario, and that would ease a lot of the flooding,\" Chow said. \"So it's happening, but we're almost there.\" In a post, Waterfront Toronto confirmed that while a small amount of water from the Don River entered the new stretch of river, the project was not at a stage of completion that would have allowed water to flow through to the new mouth Tuesday. \"A small notch was also recently made at the west end of the North Plug to allow for construction of the riverbank where it meets the wall. Some water and debris flowed into the new river here, and the water level was a little higher than usual,\" Waterfront Toronto said in its post. \"Otherwise, the storm did not impact the construction site and increased waters from the Don River were still moving by way of the Keating Channel.\" However the organization also noted that the project is not meant to protect all areas that were affected by Tuesday's flooding. \"The Port Lands Flood Protection project is designed to protect the Port Lands and portions of Leslieville and South Riverdale in a storm even bigger than yesterday's. It is not designed to mitigate flooding on the Don Valley Parkway, which remains within the Don River flood plain.\" Speaking with CP24 Tuesday, Environment Canada Senior Climatologist Dave Phillips said that while the city might typically see one or two thunderstorms with heavy rain in a month, Tuesday brought three in quick succession and the infrastructure was not designed to cope. \"So huge amounts of rain and the system, the city infrastructure, couldn't take it. It was overworked. He pointed out that Toronto is \"a different city\" than it was about 20 or 30 years ago, with far more concrete surfaces and less green space that could absorb heavy rainfall. Chow reiterated Wednesday that the city has been looking at ways to encourage people not to pave their properties over with nonporous surfaces. \"We want to do more. For big parking lots, if it's just concrete, the water basically just runs off,\" Chow said. \"What we want them to do is have interlocking bricks, so that the water can seep into the ground, rather than just run off and flood everything else.\" Earlier this year, staff proposed a separate tax be added to utility bills as a fixed charge, depending on the size of the paved area on a property.  The move led to cries that Toronto was trying to add a \"rain tax.\" Chow directed staff to take another look following an outcry, but said at the time that it was important to have a plan that supports more green infrastructure, prevents flooding, and keeps water bills low.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Thursday, July 18, 2024 1:56PM EDT Two deaths as a result of a listeriosis outbreak linked to a plant-based milk recall are in Ontario, provincial health officials confirmed Thursday. Silk brand almond milk, coconut milk, almond-coconut milk and oat milk, as well as Great Value brand almond milk, were recalled earlier this month. \"At this point in time, the Ministry of Health can confirm that 2 deaths in Ontario have been related to this outbreak,\" a spokesperson told CP24 in an email. \"The Ministry of Health is working closely with Local Public Health Agencies, Public Health Ontario, the CFIA, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada regarding the recall of these products.\" At least 12 lab-confirmed cases of listeriosis have been reported in connection with the recall, including 10 in Ontario and one each in Quebec and Nova Scotia. All of the affected products, of which there are 18, include the product code 7825 and best-before dates up to and including Oct. 4. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), products contaminated with listeria may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick and include symptoms like vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness. “Pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, the infection can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth. In severe cases of illness, people may die,” PHAC said in the recall. READ MORE: What is listeriosis, the illness recently linked to a recall of plant-based milks? Of the reported listeriosis cases in Canada, 67 per cent were reported in women and the ages of those hospitalized are between 37 and 89. PHAC said the people who became sick developed symptoms between August 2023 and early July 2024. Health officials warned that more infections may continue to be reported as the illness reporting period for this outbreak is between nine and 35 days. In a statement issued Wednesday, the president of Danone Canada, Frédéric Guichard, said all 15 of the Silk products have been removed from shelves across the country. \"The news in this notice is devastating and our most sincere sympathies go out to the families and loved ones during this difficult time,” he said. It’s unclear if the three Great Value products, which are produced by Walmart, are still on the shelves. If you believe you have one of the affected products in your home, PHAC advises to throw the items out or return them to where they were purchased.</td>\n",

Silk brand almond milk, coconut milk, almond-coconut milk and oat milk, as well as Great Value brand almond milk, were recalled earlier this month. \\\"At this point in time, the Ministry of Health can confirm that 2 deaths in Ontario have been related to this outbreak,\\\" a spokesperson told CP24 in an email. \\\"The Ministry of Health is working closely with Local Public Health Agencies, Public Health Ontario, the CFIA, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada regarding the recall of these products.\\\" At least 12 lab-confirmed cases of listeriosis have been reported in connection with the recall, including 10 in Ontario and one each in Quebec and Nova Scotia. All of the affected products, of which there are 18, include the product code 7825 and best-before dates up to and including Oct. 4. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), products contaminated with listeria may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick and include symptoms like vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness. \\u201cPregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, the infection can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth. In severe cases of illness, people may die,\\u201d PHAC said in the recall. READ MORE: What is listeriosis, the illness recently linked to a recall of plant-based milks? Of the reported listeriosis cases in Canada, 67 per cent were reported in women and the ages of those hospitalized are between 37 and 89. PHAC said the people who became sick developed symptoms between August 2023 and early July 2024. Health officials warned that more infections may continue to be reported as the illness reporting period for this outbreak is between nine and 35 days. In a statement issued Wednesday, the president of Danone Canada, Fr\\u00e9d\\u00e9ric Guichard, said all 15 of the Silk products have been removed from shelves across the country. \\\"The news in this notice is devastating and our most sincere sympathies go out to the families and loved ones during this difficult time,\\u201d he said. It\\u2019s unclear if the three Great Value products, which are produced by Walmart, are still on the shelves. If you believe you have one of the affected products in your home, PHAC advises to throw the items out or return them to where they were purchased. \",\n          \" Wednesday, July 17, 2024 5:27PM EDT A massive rainstorm which flooded roads, basements and businesses in the city Tuesday is raising questions about Toronto's preparedness when it comes to major weather events. The storm, which dumped a month's worth of rain on the city in a matter of hours, overwhelmed sewer systems and waterways, causing damage and hampering transit. While such storms are rare, they are not unheard of. Another storm about a decade ago in 2013 caused major flooding, submerging vehicles and necessitating the rescue of passengers from a half-submerged GO Train. With more adverse weather expected due to climate change, the city has undertaken flood mitigation work over the past decade, including a massive project to reroute the mouth of the Don River to add flood protection in the Port Lands \\u2013 a project which marked a major milestone just last week and which is expected to be compete by the end of this year. But the fact that the city has undertaken flood protection work over the past few years left some wondering why the city was then so overwhelmed by Tuesday's storm. Speaking on CTV Your Morning Wednesday, Mayor Olivia Chow said flood mitigation is at various stages of work in areas across the city, with some projects still waiting for dollars to flow. \\\"The west area, still some of those homeowners can't even get insurance for their basements because they've been flooding so much,\\\" Chow said. \\\"So we're waiting for the federal government to join us to really do flood mitigation measures in the west end of the city. It's about $300 million, and they've said yes, it's just we're waiting for the funds to flow.\\\" Chow said the city also has \\\"very, very aggressive\\\" plans to build more housing in the East Harbour area, east of the Don River, but is also waiting on about $200 million from the federal government for flood protection. However she did note that Ottawa has contributed in a \\\"big\\\" way to flood protection with the project to naturalize the mouth of the Don River. One of the massive concrete \\\"plugs\\\" separating the newly-created stretch of river was removed last week. Once all of the plugs have been removed, the river will flow out through the new mouth, instead of emptying into the narrow Keating Channel. \\\"The last plug about to be pulled out in the next couple of months, that will allow the Don River to flow into Lake Ontario, and that would ease a lot of the flooding,\\\" Chow said. \\\"So it's happening, but we're almost there.\\\" In a post, Waterfront Toronto confirmed that while a small amount of water from the Don River entered the new stretch of river, the project was not at a stage of completion that would have allowed water to flow through to the new mouth Tuesday. \\\"A small notch was also recently made at the west end of the North Plug to allow for construction of the riverbank where it meets the wall. Some water and debris flowed into the new river here, and the water level was a little higher than usual,\\\" Waterfront Toronto said in its post. \\\"Otherwise, the storm did not impact the construction site and increased waters from the Don River were still moving by way of the Keating Channel.\\\" However the organization also noted that the project is not meant to protect all areas that were affected by Tuesday's flooding. \\\"The Port Lands Flood Protection project is designed to protect the Port Lands and portions of Leslieville and South Riverdale in a storm even bigger than yesterday's. It is not designed to mitigate flooding on the Don Valley Parkway, which remains within the Don River flood plain.\\\" Speaking with CP24 Tuesday, Environment Canada Senior Climatologist Dave Phillips said that while the city might typically see one or two thunderstorms with heavy rain in a month, Tuesday brought three in quick succession and the infrastructure was not designed to cope. \\\"So huge amounts of rain and the system, the city infrastructure, couldn't take it. It was overworked. He pointed out that Toronto is \\\"a different city\\\" than it was about 20 or 30 years ago, with far more concrete surfaces and less green space that could absorb heavy rainfall. Chow reiterated Wednesday that the city has been looking at ways to encourage people not to pave their properties over with nonporous surfaces. \\\"We want to do more. For big parking lots, if it's just concrete, the water basically just runs off,\\\" Chow said. \\\"What we want them to do is have interlocking bricks, so that the water can seep into the ground, rather than just run off and flood everything else.\\\" Earlier this year, staff proposed a separate tax be added to utility bills as a fixed charge, depending on the size of the paved area on a property. \\u00a0The move led to cries that Toronto was trying to add a \\\"rain tax.\\\" Chow directed staff to take another look following an outcry, but said at the time that it was important to have a plan that supports more green infrastructure, prevents flooding, and keeps water bills low. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_lenght\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1643,\n        \"min\": 2637,\n        \"max\": 4961,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2637,\n          4961\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Silk brand almond milk, coconut milk, almond-coconut milk and oat milk were recalled earlier this month .
