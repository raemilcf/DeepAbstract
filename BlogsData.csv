0,Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Simulated Data in Python,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Marcus Sena Follow Towards Data Science -- Listen Share Imagine you just coded a machine learning model and need to test it on specific scenarios, or you are publishing an academic paper about a custom data science solution but the available datasets have copyright limitations. On the other hand, you might be in the debugging and troubleshooting phase of a machine learning project and need data to identify and resolve issues. All these situations, and many more, can benefit from using simulated data. Frequently, real-world data is not readily available, expensive, or private. Therefore, creating synthetic data is a useful skill for data science practitioners and professionals. In this article, I present some methods and techniques for creating simulated data, toy datasets, and ""dummy"" values from scratch using Python. Some solutions use methods from Python libraries and others are techniques that use built-in Python functions. All the methods shown in the next sections were useful for me at some point in research tasks, academic papers, model training, or testing. I hope the reader explores the notebook at the end of the article and uses it as a guide or keeps it as a reference for future projects. Table of contents1. Using NumPy2. Using Scikit-learn3. Using SciPy4. Using Faker5. Using Synthetic Data Vault (SDV)Conclusions and Next Steps The most famous Python library for dealing with linear algebra and numerical computing is also helpful for data generation. In this example, I’ll show how to create a dataset with noise having a linear relationship with the target values. It can be useful for testing linear regression models. In this example, I'll use NumPy to generate synthetic time series data with a linear trend and a seasonal component. That example is useful for financial modeling and stock market prediction. Sometimes it's needed data with particular characteristics. For example, you may need a high-dimensional dataset with only a few informative dimensions for dimensionality reduction tasks. In that case, the example below shows an adequate method to generate such datasets. The code snippet above creates a dataset with 100 observations and 6 features based on a lower dimensional array of only 3 dimensions. In addition to machine learning models, Scikit-learn has data generators useful for building artificial datasets with controlled size and complexity. The make_classification method can be used to create a random n-class dataset. That method allows the creation of datasets with a chosen number of observations, features, and classes. It can be useful for testing and debugging classification models such as support vector machines, decision trees, and Naive Bayes. Similarly, the make_regression method is useful for creating datasets for regression analysis. It allows to set the number of observations, the number of features, the bias, and the noise of the resulting dataset. The make_blobs method allows the creation of artificial ""blobs"" with data that can be used for clustering tasks. It allows setting the total number of points in the dataset, the number of clusters, and the intra-cluster standard deviation. The SciPy (short for Scientific Python) library is, along with NumPy, one of the best ones for handling numerical computing, optimization, statistical analysis, and many other mathematical tasks. The stats model of SciPy can create simulated data from many statistical distributions, such as normal, binomial, and exponential distributions. What about non-numerical data? Often we need to train our model on non-numerical or user data such as name, address, and email. A solution for creating realistic data similar to user information is using the Faker Python library. The Faker Library can generate convincing data that can be used to test applications and machine learning classifiers. In the example below, I show how to create a fake dataset with name, address, phone number, and email information. What if you have a dataset that doesn't have enough observations or you need more data similar to an existing dataset to supplement the training step of your machine-learning model? The Synthetic Data Vault (SDV) is a Python library that allows the creation of synthetic datasets using statistical models. In the example below, we'll use SDV to expand a demo dataset: Observe how the data is very similar to the original dataset but it's synthetic data. The article presented 5 ways of creating simulated and synthetic datasets that can be used for machine-learning projects, statistical modeling, and other tasks involving data. The examples shown are easy to follow, so I recommend exploring the code, reading the documentation available, and developing other data generation methods more suitable to every need. As said before, data scientists, machine learning professionals, and developers can gain from using synthetic datasets by improving model performance and lowering the costs of production and application testing.

2,I spent 18 months rebuilding my algorithmic trading platform in Rust.

On paper, Rust seemed like the programming languages designed by the gods. Not only is it the fastest programming language out there, its also one of the safest. I’m not alone in thinking Rust was this perfect language. If you read about the Rust programming language online, you’ll likely encounter overwhelmingly positive opinions. Every guide on Medium, every post on Reddit, every answer on Stack Overflow — everything is glowing.

3,Overcoming the Coding Grind: How I Went from Novice to Software Engineer with These 5 Tips,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jhury Kevin Follow -- 1 Listen Share I still vividly remember the time when I was still starting out my coding journey. It was at times frustrating, but every bit of it was exciting and worth it. I didn’t have a mentor or anyone to guide me. However, I had the drive to pursue a career in software engineering and the consistency to solve problems on a daily basis. In this article, I will briefly discuss my roadmap, habits, and some of the things I learned during my journey as a student up until becoming a level 2 software engineer working for international clients even before I graduated from college. I was studying a major in Computer Engineering at our local university. The curriculum is heavily based on low-level computer architecture, microprocessors, and embedded systems. These courses were sort of my foundation, but I already knew that modern applications development and software engineering itself is an entirely different animal. Most of my knowledge is self-taught outside of what I learned from school. My degree program supports my skillset in a way that I can easily understand the inner workings of how my applications work, down to the hardware level. YouTube and other free online courses provide good material when starting out with a framework. The problem I’ve seen on a lot of beginners is not the material they are watching, but on the habit they are building with regards to learning based solely on what YouTube videos provide. Real-world software development involves reading lots of documentation, understanding a certain feature’s acceptance criteria, and creating your own algorithms. Tutorial videos are good, but they are also detrimental to your growth when you rely on them for everything. These videos are not allowing you to step out of your comfort zone and debug problems on your own. Once you're done with a course, build a project on your own based on what you’ve learned. Use the codebase as a reference and build something on top of it. Add a new API, create new features, or modify the thing entirely to fit your specific use-case or problem. Once you’ve started to understand what you’re studying, the hardest part is to motivate yourself on being consistent. You can’t learn something today and set things aside for weeks. Even for me, everyday wasn’t always a day where I was motivated to code and learn new things. I also took occasional breaks, but I always reminded myself on why I started on what I was doing in the first place. Professional athletes weren’t gifted with their current abilities when they were born. It took hours and years of constant practice just to reach the current skillset that they have right now. The same principle applies to learning any new skill, including coding and software engineering. To err is human. It is completely normal to fail at something. Committing mistakes are proof that you are growing and learning. Not having them is paramount to not challenging yourself enough. If you are not making mistakes, you might be staying within your comfort zone and not pushing the boundaries of your capabilities. Failure provides valuable lessons and insights that success often cannot. I myself, have failed a lot of times both personally and professionally at work. I have been rejected at a lot of companies, and I have sometimes failed to meet the expectations of my colleagues. You have to remember that these experiences are not something that lowers your value and ability to be a software engineer. Rather, they are a testament that you still have a lot of things to learn and improve within yourself to become better. In conjunction, you can’t learn and absorb a huge chunk of information in the span of a week or even months. You can’t jump from a junior-level developer to a senior-level dev in just 2 weeks. It is also important to set realistic goals on how you want to improve. This not only makes the learning process less overwhelming but also gives you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each task. As technology moves forward and as more people are getting into studying tech, now is the perfect time to join organizations and become active in your local tech community. Networking opportunities can provide mentorships from industry professionals who are already experts in the field. You can talk with like-minded people, exchange ideas, and share your insights about what you’re currently working on. Networking events can also provide you with job opportunities to land your first dream job! Teaching on the other hand is very close to my heart. With teaching, I can reinforce a lot of the concepts I have learned and help other people on their own learning journeys. When you teach, you are not only solidifying your own understanding but also contributing to the growth of the community. By explaining complex concepts in simpler terms, you deepen your own knowledge, uncover any gaps in your understanding, and even improve your soft skills and communication skills. In my opinion, although tech-skills are the lifeline of this work, it is rare to find developers who can accurately express their thoughts professionally, and even personally. As developers, I hate to admit, we are biased with the code we write. As such, internships and industry work provide opportunities for you to have someone else review your work. This external perspective is invaluable as it helps identify areas for improvement and introduces you to best practices that you might not have considered. Industry work also enforces you to adhere to standards which may vary from company to company. Internships allow you to deal with real-world problems, deadlines, and fulfilling your role within a team of professionals. This helps you develop strong collaboration and communication skills, which are crucial in any professional setting. Before I end this article, I would like to share a bit of my roadmap before I graduated and the projects I did throughout approximately 2 years from my sophomore year to my Senior year in college. I hope you learned something from my article. If you have questions, feel free to reach out at my socials and I wish you the best of luck in your journey to become a professional in the tech-industry. Kudos! -- -- 1 Hi!

4,RFM Segmentation: Unleashing Customer Insights,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Vito Rihaldijiran Follow Towards Data Science -- 1 Listen Share The methods vary when we talk about customer segmentation. Well, it depends on what we aim to achieve, but the primary purpose of customer segmentation is to put customers in different kinds of groups according to their similarities. This method, in practical applications, will help businesses specify their market segments with tailored marketing strategies based on the information from the segmentation. RFM segmentation is one example of customer segmentation. RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary. This technique is prevalent in commercial businesses due to its straightforward yet powerful approach. According to its abbreviation, we can define each metric in RFM as follows: The workflow of RFM segmentation is relatively straightforward. First, we collect data about customer transactions in a selected period. Please ensure we already know when the customer is transacting, how many quantities of particular products the customer buys in each transaction, and how much money the customer spends. After that, we will do the scoring. There are so many thresholds available for us to consider, but how about we opt for a scale ranging from 1 to 5 to evaluate each —where 1 represents the lowest score while 5 stands for the highest score. In the final step, we combine the three scores to create customer segments. For example, the customer who has the highest RFM score (5 in recency, frequency, and monetary) is seen as loyal, while the customer with the lowest RFM score (1 in recency, frequency, and monetary) is seen as a churning user. In the following parts of the article, we will create an RFM segmentation utilizing a popular unsupervised learning technique known as K-Means. We don’t need to collect the data in this practical example because we already have the dataset. We will use the Online Retail II dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is licensed under CC BY 4.0 and eligible for commercial use. You can access the dataset for free through this link. The dataset has all the information regarding customer transactions in online retail businesses, such as InvoiceDate, Quantity, and Price. There are two files in the dataset, but we will use the “Year 2010–2011” version in this example. Now, let’s do the code. Step 1: Data Preparation The first step is we do the data preparation. We do this as follows: The data preparation process is essential because the segmentation will refer to the data we process in this step. After we load the libraries and load the data, we perform the following steps: The data will be look like this after this step: Step 2: Calculate & Scale RFM Metrics In this step, we’ll calculate each metric and scale those before the clustering part. We do this as follows: We divide this step into three parts: After we complete this step, the result in the RFM dataset will look like this: And the scaled dataset will look like this: Step 3: K-Means Clustering Now we come to the final step, K-Means Clustering. We do this by: The first part of this step is determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method. The method is wss or “within-cluster sum of squares”, which measures the compactness of the clusters. This method works by choosing the number of clusters at the point where the wss starts to diminish rapidly, and forming an “elbow.” The elbow diminishes at 4. The next part is we do the clustering. We specify 4 as the number of clusters and 25 as random sets of initial cluster centers and then choose the best one based on the lowest within-cluster sum of squares. Then, add it to the cluster to the RFM dataset. The visualization of the cluster can be seen below: Note that the sizes of the clusters in the plot are not directly related to the count of customers in each cluster. The visualization shows the spread of the data points in each cluster based on the scaled RFM scores (R_Score, F_Score, M_Score) rather than the number of customers. With running this code, the summary of RFM segmentation can be seen as follows: From the summary, we can get generate insights from each cluster. The suggestions will vary greatly. However, what I can think of if I were a Data Scientist in an online retail business is the following: Congrats! you already know how to conduct RFM Segmentation using K-Means, now it’s your turn to do the same way with your own dataset. -- -- 1 Towards Data Science Postgrad at ANU School of Computing // https://www.linkedin.com/in/vito-rihaldijiran/ Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "

8,Overcoming the Coding Grind: How I Went from Novice to Software Engineer with These 5 Tips,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jhury Kevin Follow -- 1 Listen Share I still vividly remember the time when I was still starting out my coding journey. It was at times frustrating, but every bit of it was exciting and worth it. I didn’t have a mentor or anyone to guide me. However, I had the drive to pursue a career in software engineering and the consistency to solve problems on a daily basis. In this article, I will briefly discuss my roadmap, habits, and some of the things I learned during my journey as a student up until becoming a level 2 software engineer working for international clients even before I graduated from college. I was studying a major in Computer Engineering at our local university. The curriculum is heavily based on low-level computer architecture, microprocessors, and embedded systems. These courses were sort of my foundation, but I already knew that modern applications development and software engineering itself is an entirely different animal. Most of my knowledge is self-taught outside of what I learned from school. My degree program supports my skillset in a way that I can easily understand the inner workings of how my applications work, down to the hardware level. YouTube and other free online courses provide good material when starting out with a framework. The problem I’ve seen on a lot of beginners is not the material they are watching, but on the habit they are building with regards to learning based solely on what YouTube videos provide. Real-world software development involves reading lots of documentation, understanding a certain feature’s acceptance criteria, and creating your own algorithms. Tutorial videos are good, but they are also detrimental to your growth when you rely on them for everything. These videos are not allowing you to step out of your comfort zone and debug problems on your own. Once you're done with a course, build a project on your own based on what you’ve learned. Use the codebase as a reference and build something on top of it. Add a new API, create new features, or modify the thing entirely to fit your specific use-case or problem. Once you’ve started to understand what you’re studying, the hardest part is to motivate yourself on being consistent. You can’t learn something today and set things aside for weeks. Even for me, everyday wasn’t always a day where I was motivated to code and learn new things. I also took occasional breaks, but I always reminded myself on why I started on what I was doing in the first place. Professional athletes weren’t gifted with their current abilities when they were born. It took hours and years of constant practice just to reach the current skillset that they have right now. The same principle applies to learning any new skill, including coding and software engineering. To err is human. It is completely normal to fail at something. Committing mistakes are proof that you are growing and learning. Not having them is paramount to not challenging yourself enough. If you are not making mistakes, you might be staying within your comfort zone and not pushing the boundaries of your capabilities. Failure provides valuable lessons and insights that success often cannot. I myself, have failed a lot of times both personally and professionally at work. I have been rejected at a lot of companies, and I have sometimes failed to meet the expectations of my colleagues. You have to remember that these experiences are not something that lowers your value and ability to be a software engineer. Rather, they are a testament that you still have a lot of things to learn and improve within yourself to become better. In conjunction, you can’t learn and absorb a huge chunk of information in the span of a week or even months. You can’t jump from a junior-level developer to a senior-level dev in just 2 weeks. It is also important to set realistic goals on how you want to improve. This not only makes the learning process less overwhelming but also gives you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each task. As technology moves forward and as more people are getting into studying tech, now is the perfect time to join organizations and become active in your local tech community. Networking opportunities can provide mentorships from industry professionals who are already experts in the field. You can talk with like-minded people, exchange ideas, and share your insights about what you’re currently working on. Networking events can also provide you with job opportunities to land your first dream job! Teaching on the other hand is very close to my heart. With teaching, I can reinforce a lot of the concepts I have learned and help other people on their own learning journeys. When you teach, you are not only solidifying your own understanding but also contributing to the growth of the community. By explaining complex concepts in simpler terms, you deepen your own knowledge, uncover any gaps in your understanding, and even improve your soft skills and communication skills. In my opinion, although tech-skills are the lifeline of this work, it is rare to find developers who can accurately express their thoughts professionally, and even personally. As developers, I hate to admit, we are biased with the code we write. As such, internships and industry work provide opportunities for you to have someone else review your work. This external perspective is invaluable as it helps identify areas for improvement and introduces you to best practices that you might not have considered. Industry work also enforces you to adhere to standards which may vary from company to company. Internships allow you to deal with real-world problems, deadlines, and fulfilling your role within a team of professionals. This helps you develop strong collaboration and communication skills, which are crucial in any professional setting. Before I end this article, I would like to share a bit of my roadmap before I graduated and the projects I did throughout approximately 2 years from my sophomore year to my Senior year in college. I hope you learned something from my article. If you have questions, feel free to reach out at my socials and I wish you the best of luck in your journey to become a professional in the tech-industry. Kudos! -- -- 1 Hi!

9,RFM Segmentation: Unleashing Customer Insights,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Vito Rihaldijiran Follow Towards Data Science -- 1 Listen Share The methods vary when we talk about customer segmentation. Well, it depends on what we aim to achieve, but the primary purpose of customer segmentation is to put customers in different kinds of groups according to their similarities. This method, in practical applications, will help businesses specify their market segments with tailored marketing strategies based on the information from the segmentation. RFM segmentation is one example of customer segmentation. RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary. This technique is prevalent in commercial businesses due to its straightforward yet powerful approach. According to its abbreviation, we can define each metric in RFM as follows: The workflow of RFM segmentation is relatively straightforward. First, we collect data about customer transactions in a selected period. Please ensure we already know when the customer is transacting, how many quantities of particular products the customer buys in each transaction, and how much money the customer spends. After that, we will do the scoring. There are so many thresholds available for us to consider, but how about we opt for a scale ranging from 1 to 5 to evaluate each —where 1 represents the lowest score while 5 stands for the highest score. In the final step, we combine the three scores to create customer segments. For example, the customer who has the highest RFM score (5 in recency, frequency, and monetary) is seen as loyal, while the customer with the lowest RFM score (1 in recency, frequency, and monetary) is seen as a churning user. In the following parts of the article, we will create an RFM segmentation utilizing a popular unsupervised learning technique known as K-Means. We don’t need to collect the data in this practical example because we already have the dataset. We will use the Online Retail II dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is licensed under CC BY 4.0 and eligible for commercial use. You can access the dataset for free through this link. The dataset has all the information regarding customer transactions in online retail businesses, such as InvoiceDate, Quantity, and Price. There are two files in the dataset, but we will use the “Year 2010–2011” version in this example. Now, let’s do the code. Step 1: Data Preparation The first step is we do the data preparation. We do this as follows: The data preparation process is essential because the segmentation will refer to the data we process in this step. After we load the libraries and load the data, we perform the following steps: The data will be look like this after this step: Step 2: Calculate & Scale RFM Metrics In this step, we’ll calculate each metric and scale those before the clustering part. We do this as follows: We divide this step into three parts: After we complete this step, the result in the RFM dataset will look like this: And the scaled dataset will look like this: Step 3: K-Means Clustering Now we come to the final step, K-Means Clustering. We do this by: The first part of this step is determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method. The method is wss or “within-cluster sum of squares”, which measures the compactness of the clusters. This method works by choosing the number of clusters at the point where the wss starts to diminish rapidly, and forming an “elbow.” The elbow diminishes at 4. The next part is we do the clustering. We specify 4 as the number of clusters and 25 as random sets of initial cluster centers and then choose the best one based on the lowest within-cluster sum of squares. Then, add it to the cluster to the RFM dataset. The visualization of the cluster can be seen below: Note that the sizes of the clusters in the plot are not directly related to the count of customers in each cluster. The visualization shows the spread of the data points in each cluster based on the scaled RFM scores (R_Score, F_Score, M_Score) rather than the number of customers. With running this code, the summary of RFM segmentation can be seen as follows: From the summary, we can get generate insights from each cluster. The suggestions will vary greatly. However, what I can think of if I were a Data Scientist in an online retail business is the following: Congrats! you already know how to conduct RFM Segmentation using K-Means, now it’s your turn to do the same way with your own dataset. -- -- 1 Towards Data Science Postgrad at ANU School of Computing // https://www.linkedin.com/in/vito-rihaldijiran/ Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "

It’s so good. It captures exactly how I feel about async and await. If you wait for async code your function now has to be async as well. And if there’s any function relying on that function that code also has to be async and on and on and on. Until you reach the top level. I’ve always hated this. But there’s no better way to do this. It’s a necessary evil. Right..? Well, I’ve recently been coding a lot in Go. And Go does not have async and await. And this is despite it being famous for its concurrency. And you know what? I really like it. So the first time I realized that Go did not have async/await was when I wanted to get my function to wait one second. This is because I make an RSS reader Stratum (iOS, Android) that fetches a lot of RSS feeds. And it turns out sites don’t like it if you spam their site with requests. They will rate limit you.

11,Learning React: 5 Important Principles About Hooks You Have To Know,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Inna Sinicka Follow Code Like A Girl -- 1 Listen Share We are rapidly approaching 2025, and React will undoubtedly still be one of the most popular choices for creating front-end applications. This is not because it has no disadvantages but because of the enormous community and massive popularity that React has gained over the years. And we can’t forget about React 19, which promises us a lot, so React will not lose its position. It is hard to imagine React without hooks, but unfortunately, I often see developers overusing them. As a result, they have to solve problems with dependency arrays, useless re-renders and all the mess they have created because, profoundly in their minds, there’s a concern that everything can be done only with hooks in React. In this article, I will discuss five principles every new React programmer should know to improve and simplify their code. Let’s start with the basics and check out the definition. Hooks are defined using JavaScript functions. They represent a particular type of reusable UI logic and are restricted in where they can be called. Hooks may look like functions, but there are some differences: Let’s create a simple custom hook called useBoolean to meet these requirements. We can use it to open/close panels, dialogues, show/hide elements, etc. If you look at the official documentation, you will find that wrapping any functions that hook returns into useCallback is recommended, and we will do that. When we remember the basics, we can dive deeper and better understand some nuances. You probably ask why. Understanding how React works and what happens when you change the component’s state through the setter function is essential. At first glance, it looks like you changed state, and the result must appear immediately, but is it? When you know what is happening when the state is being changed, it is much easier to understand when and why useEffect or other hooks with dependency arrays are triggered. Let’s look at a simple example. Imagine we press the button for the first time and call onChangeText, passing the value “newValue”. It may look like we should see “newValue” in the console, but actually, there will be “defaultValue.” Why? Because the new value will be available only after re-rendering. Here is necessary to see the steps that are happening: Every time you want to change the value in the state, you need to remember that these steps are done each time. In React, we have two ways to manage the component’s state — useState and useReducer. The second is less popular because it is meant for more complex objects in the state and honestly looks too tricky at first glance for new programmers, but it is not. However, useState looks very simple and understandable, so new programmers often use it more than is required. Depending on user interactions, it is intended to manage the state for redrawing components. If you want to remember something without rendering it, you probably shouldn’t put it in the state. useRef would be the best option. Simplify your code from this: To this: We used specific lifecycle methods with Class components in particular cases. Since the React 16.8 version may look like we have one useEffect hook for everything. Not for everything, but due to a lack of documentation and incredible hype around hooks in 2019, there was a tendency to use it in all possible places. Let’s look at the official documentation: useEffect is a React Hook that lets you synchronise a component with an external system. But in reality, we use useEffect much more than needed. It is excellent for fetching data when the component mounts, but unfortunately, new programmers tend to change the state using this hook, which is not the best solution. Stop and review your code if you find yourself writing one useEffect after another inside of one component. You usually don’t need them, and you can quickly eliminate them. betterprogramming.pub Unfortunately, useRef is underrated. It is not among the most popular hooks, but it is beneficial. Knowing how and where to use it can achieve great results. Let’s start with the basics. useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value not needed for rendering. — from React official documentation. React will remember the value you create through useRef, whether you are making a Javascript object referencing a node in DOM or a simple value, and it will not be lost during re-renders. What does it give us? Examples: Hooks are great, and you should use them. You can achieve a lot if you understand how React works and apply hooks correctly. That’s all about tips for new React developers. I hope these tips will be helpful. -- -- 1 Code Like A Girl Frontend developer who writes all about React, ways to increase productivity, focus and how to be a happy programmer.

12,The Elusive Goldbach Conjecture,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Cole Frederick Follow Cantor’s Paradise -- 4 Share Math has no shortage of famous problems that are difficult to prove. Even better are puzzles that are also simple to understand. Mathematicians are always looking for problems that are easy to state and hard to solve, as these problems often yield rich insights. Fermat’s Last Theorem took almost 300 years to solve after it was originally posed, and it is simple enough to be understood by the average middle school student. For any n greater than 2, the equation xⁿ + yⁿ = zⁿ cannot be solved when x, y, and z are integers other than 0. While Fermat’s Last Theorem has been proven, many similar problems still remain unsolved. These puzzles often generate a lot of interest in the mathematical community, and sometimes even cash prizes! In this article, I’m going to talk about another famous problem that is easy to state: The Goldbach Conjecture. The statement for this conjecture is very simple, it reads as follows: Every even number greater than two can be written as the sum of two prime numbers This conjecture was first stated by amateur Prussian mathematician Christian Goldbach in 1742 in a letter to Leonhard Euler.

13,Measuring the Biggest Smiles in MLB Using Computer Vision,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Thomas Nestico Follow -- Listen Share While downloading MLB official player headshots for a graphic I was working on, an idea dawned on me which felt both very fun and interesting: “Which player has the biggest smile in MLB?” I have had some experience with Computer Vision (CV) models before but have not applied it to baseball. This felt like the perfect project to try it out with, and the end goal was ridiculous enough that people should find it entertaining. All code provided is Python. GitHub’s Co-Pilot assisted with code writing. Thanks to MLBAM, accessing information about players is simple! The first step for gathering all MLB player headshots is to gather the IDs of all MLB players. This can be done with the MLB Stats API, which includes an endpoint for accessing all players in a given MLB affiliated league. The function get_players() returns a data frame containing all relevant information for MLB players during the current season. The next step in the process is to download each player’s official MLB headshot. These can be accessed directly from MLB.com via each player’s page. Here is an example of Andrew Abbott’s player page We are interested in his headshot, which is easily accessed on this page. Here is the link to his headshot. All MLB Official Headshots are differentiated by the player’s MLBAMID, also known as their Player ID. By changing the URL to include CJ Abrams Player ID instead of Abbott’s, we can get Abrams’ headshot. Since we can simply change the ID in each URL to get the player’s headshot, we can create a column in pandas which contains all headshot URLs Now that we have the URL for each headshot, we can download all the MLB headshots to a folder. To limit the amount of calls to MLB’s server, I suggest limiting the download time between images using time.sleep(). This function will download all the URLs and store them in a folder called “headshots”. We now have all MLB headshots! Now on to the Computer Vision! Using CV we can have a model which looks at each headshot and determine the location of facial features on each player. Thankfully, there is a public model available on GitHub which has done the legwork for us! Italo José created facial-landmarks-recognition which we can use for our task. Their model places landmarks on a person’s face to define facial features. For our project, we are looking just at the landmarks which make up the mouth. This function takes an image as an input and outputs an array of the mouth coordinates which the model defines. There was some trial and error involved in my process, mostly regarding the colour conversion used for the images. The conversion I ended up using was BGR to LAB (CIELAB) as it best dealt with players which have facial hair. This is a for loop which goes through each headshot and calls the measure_smile() function. We append the “mouth_points” of each player to a list called “smile_list” and then create a column in the original data frame with the mouth points. We are defining a smile as “the portion of a player’s mouth which is between their lips”. While that may be a mouthful, it is essentially the area of teeth which the model calculates. An example would better illustrate this. For this example, we are using Oakland Athletic’s Shortstop Nick Allen, who has a Player ID of 669397. This is the code which will plot the smile of Nick Allen. Landmarks 12 and onward define the inner portion of a person’s mouth. Looking good! The model accurately highlighted Nick Allen’s smile. While the smile isn’t fully captured, it is a good approximation. Now, to determine which players have the largest smiles, we need a method to calculate the polygons which make up their smile. The shoelace formula (also known as Gauss’s area formula) is an algorithm to calculate the area of a polygon, even irregular ones. We can calculate the area of each player’s “smile” using this formula and then determine which players have the biggest smile! This code creates a column which calculates the area of each smile. With the areas calculated, we can now determine which players have the biggest smiles in MLB. To easily compare smile sizes between players, we can create a metric which quantifies a smile in terms of the average MLB smile. “Plus” Metrics are a popular subset of metrics used in baseball, which quantify a batter’s start as a percentage of the MLB Average. For these metrics, 100 is considered MLB average and every value above and below 100 corresponds to a value greater than or less than MLB average. For example, a player with a 150 OPS+ has an OPS which is 50% greater than league average (This is a simplified example which does not account for League and Park Factors). Using this methodology, I have created SMILE+ which uses a player’s smile size as the metric of interest. The formula is: Here are the Top 10 Players in SMILE+ You can find the full leaderboards here: SMILE+ Leaderboards While we achieved an encouraging outcome, there were still a few issues regarding with how the model determined (or failed to determine) the landmarks on some players faces. The CV model was sometimes confused with beards, and the biggest offender was Sean Hjelle. His closed mouth had the model considering the top of his goatee as the bottom of his mouth, which spiked his SMILE+ all the way to 298. Specifically for Hjelle, I redrew his smile coordinates and his SMILE+ dropped to 3. The CV model sometimes had trouble distinguishing between players skin tones. If a player’s skin tone and lip colour were similar, there has a chance the model would not be able to locate a mouth and return an empty list of coordinates. The most prominent example of this case was for Jhonkensy Noel, who has one of the best smiles in baseball! I redrew his smile shape and his SMILE+ ended up ranking 1st. When a player had lips which were small, the model struggled to assign accurate mouth coordinates. Colten Brewer has a great smile, but unfortunately, the model did not do an accurate job capturing its size. These are only a handful of limitations and inaccuracies present in the model. While this was a fun project to undertake, I will leave any subsequent improvements to you! I undertook this project because it felt like a fun introduction into using Computer Vision, and it sure was! While the results do not provide much practical value, I learned a lot about CV and had a blast doing so. Anytime you want to compare the smiles of MLB players, know that there was a baseball nerd who created a metric to help you do that. I hope you enjoyed this article as much as I did writing it!

15,Linear Algebra Concepts Every Data Scientist Should Know,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Benedict Neo Follow bitgrit Data Science Publication -- 5 Listen Share Linear algebra is a bedrock for all data science and machine learning tasks. It is the language that transforms theoretical models into practical solutions. It embodies principles that allow algorithms to learn from data. They’re used for This article will look at some linear algebra concepts, visual explanations, and code examples. Let’s dive right in! Code → Deepnote Notebook Vector ∘ Unit vectorVector operations ∘ Vector addition ∘ Scalar multiplication ∘ Dot productVector space ∘ Null space (kernel) ∘ Span ∘ Basis ∘ Linear IndependenceMatrix ∘ Matrices as functions ∘ Linear Transformation ∘ Inverse Matrix ∘ Singular Matrix ∘ Identity matrix. ∘ Diagonal Matrix ∘ Orthogonal matrix ∘ Matrix multiplication ∘ Trace ∘ Determinant ∘ Rank ∘ Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues This is the fundamental building block of linear algebra. There are 3 ways to think of a vector. The first is the physics perspective: vectors are arrows pointing in space, defined by length and direction. Vectors on a flat plane are 2-dimensional, and those in the space we live in are 3-dimensional. The second is the computer science perspective: vectors are ordered lists of numbers. The length of this list determines the dimension. The third is the mathematician’s perspective: vectors can be anything where two vectors are added and multiplied by a number. A unit vector is a vector with a magnitude of 1. It is often used to represent the direction of a vector without regard to its magnitude. The addition of two vectors to form a new vector, component-wise. Scalar multiplication is the multiplication of a vector by a scalar (a number) that results in the vector with the same direction (or opposite if the scalar is negative) as the original vector but with a magnitude that is scaled by the absolute value of the scalar. Formally, it is the product of the Euclidian magnitudes of two vectors and the cosine of the angle between them, reflecting both the length of the vectors and their directional relationship. Intuitively, think of it as applying the directional growth of one vector to another or “How much push/energy is one vector giving to the other?”. The result is how much stronger we’ve made the original vector (positive, negative, or zero) If the dot product is 0, it tells us that the vectors are orthogonal. A fun analogy by betterexplained Imagine the red vector is your speed, and the blue vector is the orientation of the boost pad. Larger numbers = more power. The dot product is how much boost you will get. Using the equation, |a| is your incoming speed, |b| is the max boost, the percentage of boost you get is cos(𝛉), for an overall boost of |a| |b| cos(𝛉) A vector (or linear) space is any collection of vectors that can be added together and multiplied (“scaled”) by numbers, called scalars in this context. A list of axioms must be satisfied for V to be called a vector space. The null space is a set of vectors that, when multiplied by the matrix, results in the zero vector. It represents the solution to the equation Ax = 0, where A is the given matrix. Imagine a 2d space with two vectors; the null space of a matrix can be visualized as a subspace that collapses these vectors to the origin (zero vector) when multiplied by the matrix. The set of all possible vectors you can reach given a linear combination of a given pair of vectors, v and w, av + bw, and let a and b be all real numbers. For most pairs of vectors, it can reach every point in the 2d vector plane When the two vectors happen to line up, it is limited to the single line that passes through the origin. The idea of span underlies the idea of basis. The basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the entire vector space. This means every vector in the vector space can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vector. Think of them as the building blocks for all other vectors in the space. It’s helpful to think of a single vector as an arrow, but for a collection of vectors, think of it as points. Most pairs of basis vectors can span the entire two-dimensional sheet of space. A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vectors in the set can be written as a linear combination of others (e.g., a linear combination of x and y would be any expression that forms ax + by, where a and b are constants) Matrices are a way to organize inputs and operations in rows and columns. Here’s a matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns. They’re a mathematical tool that can solve problems in a structured manner. You can think of matrices as functions. Just as a Python function takes input parameters, processes them, and returns output, a matrix transformation transforms input vectors into output vectors through linear transformation. A linear transformation is a mapping V → W between two vector spaces that preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. In practical terms, applying a matrix A to a vector x to get another vector y (via the operation Ax = y) is a linear transformation. This is used heavily in data science: Below are a few forms of matrices A matrix, when multiplied by its inverse, results in the identity matrix. A singular matrix is a square matrix that does not have an inverse. This is equivalent to saying the matrix’s determinant is zero or its rank is less than its size. The identity matrix is a square matrix with values of one on the diagonals and zero everywhere else. It acts as a multiplicative identity in matrix multiplication, leaving any matrix unchanged by it, just like the number 1. A diagonal matrix is a square matrix where all entries outside the main diagonal are zero. It is used in finding eigenvalues, and for calculating the determinant. A square matrix with real elements is considered orthogonal if its transpose equals its inverse. Formally, a matrix A is orthogonal if AᵀA=AAᵀ = I, where I is the identity matrix. Geometrically, a matrix is orthogonal if its columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors, a.k.a. they are mutually perpendicular and have a magnitude of 1. Recall that two vectors are orthogonal if they are perpendicular to each other (90 degrees) and the dot product between them is 0. You use matrices to perform matrix multiplication. Here’s a nice visualization from An Intuitive Guide to Linear Algebra Imagine you’re pouring each input data through each operation. Here’s an example of this operation. After pouring into the operations, you get this. The input was a [3 x 2] matrix, and our operation matrix is [2 x 3]; the result is [2 x 3] [3 x 2 ] = [2 x 2]. The size of the input has to match the size of the operation. The trace of a matrix is the sum of all its diagonal elements. It is invariant under the change of basis and provides value information about the matrix, i.e., the trace is the sum of the eigenvalues of a matrix. Determinant is the size of the output transformation. If the input was the unit vector (area or volume of 1), the determinant is the size of the transformed area or volume. Take this matrix, for example. If the area of A was scaled by 6, the determinant of the transformation is 6. A negative determinant tells us that the entire space was flipped. A transformation of this is like turning a set of paper onto the other side. Notice how the orientation of the red and green axes was reversed. A determinant of 0 means the matrix is “destructive” and cannot be reversed. Similar to multiplying by zero, information is lost. Determinants can tell us whether a matrix is invertible if det(A) is 0, the inverse does not exist; the matrix is singular. The maximum number of linearly independent column/row vectors in a matrix. It represents the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows or columns. It also tells us the number of output dimensions after a linear transformation. When the output of a transformation is a single line (it is one-dimensional), we say the transformation has a rank of 1. If all vectors land on some two-dimensional plane, we say the transformation has a rank of 2. For a 2x2 matrix, a rank of 2 is the best that it can be. This is known as a full rank. It means the basis vectors can span the entire 2d space and the non-zero determinant. But for 3x3 matrices, a rank of 2 means it collapsed, but not as much as a rank of 1. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues represent the “axes” of transformation. Eigenvectors are inputs that don’t change direction after a linear transformation. Even though the direction doesn’t change, the size might. This size, the amount that the eigenvector is scaled up or down, is the eigenvalue. Think about when you spin a globe; every location faces a new direction except the poles. Their direction doesn’t change. Here’s a visual example of eigenvectors. Formally, for a matrix A and a vector v, if Av = λv, then λ is an eigenvalue, and v is an eigenvector of A. Anther way of saying this is the eigenvectors of a square matrix A are vectors for which matrix multiplication = scalar multiplication.

16,Super Powering our Freelancer Recommendation System using a Vector Database,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Nicolas Mauti Follow malt-engineering -- Listen Share Malt’s mission is to connect freelancers with the perfect project. Our data team continuously works to improve the recommendation system powering these connections. In 2023, we made a significant leap forward thanks to a new architecture designed to boost the precision, speed, and scalability of our matching process. This article takes you through the development of the system, the challenges faced, and the choices behind our ‘retriever-ranker architecture’. Notably, vector databases have been critical for this solution: how we selected our technology partner and implemented it. Back in 2021, we released the first version of our automatic matching between freelancers and projects, relying on a single, monolithic model. Over time, we brought more capabilities to this model, such as multilingual support, and improved its performance. However, the architecture resulted in slow response times (up to one minute!) and made it difficult to adapt for future needs and new large language models that could handle the most complex matching cases in real time. Recognizing the limitations of our model (slowness, inflexibility, etc.) led us to explore alternative solutions in 2023. In our search for the most effective way to match freelancers and projects, we explored several methodologies, including cross-encoders and bi-encoders, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. A cross-encoder is a neural model that processes two input texts jointly to produce a single output score or classification. It allows for complex interactions between the inputs, making it highly effective for tasks like relevance ranking or text pair classification. When looking to measure the relevance between a freelancer and a project, our two entities, a cross-encoder model is a natural start. In this setup, there is only one model that encodes both elements simultaneously and then outputs a relevance score: on 0 to 1, how good of a match is that pair? This approach works great; the quality (precision) is really good because the model can capture complex relationships between the two entities. However, it is slow: for each project we receive (for instance, a client seeking a Java developer), we need to create a pairing with each freelancer (over 700,000 at the time of writing) and process each project-freelancer pair through the model, thus computing over 700,000 pairs! On the other hand, we can build what we call a bi-encoder: In this setup, both entities are encoded separately (using the same or two dedicated encoders / models) to produce an embedding–a vector that represents the entity in a semantic space. We can then use a similarity measure, such as cosine similarity, to compare the embeddings and obtain a relevancy score. The results of this method are not as good as the cross-encoder, as we lose the relationship between the freelancer and the project, but it is fast. Since the encodings are independent, we can precompute all the embeddings for the freelancers and then, at inference time: In our case, we aimed to find a balance between speed and accuracy, ensuring that our system could handle the scale of our platform while delivering matches of the highest quality. That is why we decided to build a two-step process called Retriever-Ranker: Let’s go back to our example: Ultimately, we decided to deploy this matching system in two phases: first by deploying a retriever that sits before our actual matching model (that acts as the ranker). This setup allows us to validate the scalability and performance of the retriever. Then we can develop a more complex ranker on top of it. At the time of writing, our new ranker is still in development, so let’s focus on the retriever deployment. At the heart of the Retriever’s efficiency is its bi-encoder structure. This setup allows for the independent encoding of freelancer and project information into high-dimensional vectors (called embeddings). The key advantage here is the pre-computability of these embeddings: Freelancer profiles can be encoded ahead of time and stored, ready to be compared against any new project that comes in. When a new project is posted, its details are encoded into a vector in real-time. This project vector is then compared against the precomputed freelancer vectors using a similarity measure, like cosine similarity. In order to build these embeddings, we needed to develop two models (one for freelancer profiles and another one for projects). The details of these models, developed by our data science team would require a dedicated article so we won’t cover that here. Instead, the main facts about them: Here is a 2D projection of 10 000 of freelancers in our latent space, colored by their Malt’s category. We can see that freelancers in the same category are close to each other: Once the models were ready, we had to think about the infrastructure to store the precomputed vectors and serve them efficiently. For these purposes, a vector database seemed to be the perfect solution. We quickly considered looking at vector database solutions in our architecture, as we identified three main benefits: In summary, the adoption of a vector database was a crucial step in the development of our new matching system. In 2022, this technology became very popular (especially for Generative AI related applications) and the number of actors on the market exploded. In the next section, we explain how we approached the selection of the database and evaluated the various options. Our selection of vector database technology was guided by a set of criteria, each reflecting a core need for the us: Is filtering absolutely necessary to be performed within the vector database? What about applying it before or after the semantic search? We benchmarked several vector databases, testing their performance, ANN quality, and filtering capabilities under conditions that mimicked our real-world use case. Some of the databases we evaluated included: Why didn’t you benchmark more solutions / <insert your favorite> vector database than just these three? In fact we took a look at other providers, including well-known players like Pinecone but we had to exclude them. That is mainly because of the filtering capabilities of the databases: our use case includes filtering on geo-spatial data (to recommend freelancers next to projects) and only few databases support this feature currently. About this benchmark: This benchmark revealed significant variations in performance and capabilities: After thorough evaluation, Qdrant emerged as the optimal choice for our system, offering the best blend of speed, accuracy, and functionality. Its ability to handle our specific demands for vector search and filtering (especially geo-spatial), combined with its scalability and performance, made it the clear winner in our selection process. The process of implementing and deploying our database of choice was crucial to ensure that the theoretical benefits of the vector database would translate into tangible improvements in the matching system’s performance and reliability. To maximize the availability and scalability, Qdrant has the capability to be deployed in cluster configuration. This setup involved multiple Qdrant nodes organized in a manner that ensures data is replicated and balanced across the cluster, providing both redundancy and efficient query processing. We decided to self-host the solution on our Kubernetes clusters. Qdrant team provides Docker image (encapsulating the database along with its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different development and production environments) and an Helm chart that contains the definition of all the needed Kubernetes objects, streamlining the deployment process, making it reproducible and scalable. Regarding the monitoring, Qdrant exposes its metrics in Prometheus/OpenMetrics format and we coupled this with Grafana to provide real-time insights into the health, performance, and availability of our Qdrant nodes, allowing us to quickly identify and address any issues. As a result of this work, we deployed our retriever-ranker architecture in 2023. We placed our new neural retriever, backed by the vector database, before the current matching model. This marked a significant milestone for our matching system. We saw a huge improvement in response times, with p95 latency dropping from tens of seconds (sometimes taking over a minute!) to a snappy 3 seconds at most. All this was achieved without sacrificing the quality of our recommendations, which was confirmed by an increase in the conversion of projects in our AB test. This performance improvement goes beyond technical success. It unlocks new possibilities for Malt, enabling us to recommend freelancers in near real-time, significantly enhancing the user experience. The validation of our embedding model and retriever-ranker architecture opens doors for continued exploration and future developments: Projects like the one presented in this article are never the work of just one person. I would like to thank the Malt Data and Data Science team for their invaluable contributions and hard work, as well as the reviewers for their insightful feedback throughout the process of writing this article. -- -- malt-engineering MLOps Engineer from Lyon (France), Working at Malt www.malt.com Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "
17,RFM Segmentation: Unleashing Customer Insights,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Vito Rihaldijiran Follow Towards Data Science -- 1 Listen Share The methods vary when we talk about customer segmentation. Well, it depends on what we aim to achieve, but the primary purpose of customer segmentation is to put customers in different kinds of groups according to their similarities. This method, in practical applications, will help businesses specify their market segments with tailored marketing strategies based on the information from the segmentation. RFM segmentation is one example of customer segmentation. RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary. This technique is prevalent in commercial businesses due to its straightforward yet powerful approach. According to its abbreviation, we can define each metric in RFM as follows: The workflow of RFM segmentation is relatively straightforward. First, we collect data about customer transactions in a selected period. Please ensure we already know when the customer is transacting, how many quantities of particular products the customer buys in each transaction, and how much money the customer spends. After that, we will do the scoring. There are so many thresholds available for us to consider, but how about we opt for a scale ranging from 1 to 5 to evaluate each —where 1 represents the lowest score while 5 stands for the highest score. In the final step, we combine the three scores to create customer segments. For example, the customer who has the highest RFM score (5 in recency, frequency, and monetary) is seen as loyal, while the customer with the lowest RFM score (1 in recency, frequency, and monetary) is seen as a churning user. In the following parts of the article, we will create an RFM segmentation utilizing a popular unsupervised learning technique known as K-Means. We don’t need to collect the data in this practical example because we already have the dataset. We will use the Online Retail II dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is licensed under CC BY 4.0 and eligible for commercial use. You can access the dataset for free through this link. The dataset has all the information regarding customer transactions in online retail businesses, such as InvoiceDate, Quantity, and Price. There are two files in the dataset, but we will use the “Year 2010–2011” version in this example. Now, let’s do the code. Step 1: Data Preparation The first step is we do the data preparation. We do this as follows: The data preparation process is essential because the segmentation will refer to the data we process in this step. After we load the libraries and load the data, we perform the following steps: The data will be look like this after this step: Step 2: Calculate & Scale RFM Metrics In this step, we’ll calculate each metric and scale those before the clustering part. We do this as follows: We divide this step into three parts: After we complete this step, the result in the RFM dataset will look like this: And the scaled dataset will look like this: Step 3: K-Means Clustering Now we come to the final step, K-Means Clustering. We do this by: The first part of this step is determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method. The method is wss or “within-cluster sum of squares”, which measures the compactness of the clusters. This method works by choosing the number of clusters at the point where the wss starts to diminish rapidly, and forming an “elbow.” The elbow diminishes at 4. The next part is we do the clustering. We specify 4 as the number of clusters and 25 as random sets of initial cluster centers and then choose the best one based on the lowest within-cluster sum of squares. Then, add it to the cluster to the RFM dataset. The visualization of the cluster can be seen below: Note that the sizes of the clusters in the plot are not directly related to the count of customers in each cluster. The visualization shows the spread of the data points in each cluster based on the scaled RFM scores (R_Score, F_Score, M_Score) rather than the number of customers. With running this code, the summary of RFM segmentation can be seen as follows: From the summary, we can get generate insights from each cluster. The suggestions will vary greatly. However, what I can think of if I were a Data Scientist in an online retail business is the following: Congrats! you already know how to conduct RFM Segmentation using K-Means, now it’s your turn to do the same way with your own dataset. -- -- 1 Towards Data Science Postgrad at ANU School of Computing // https://www.linkedin.com/in/vito-rihaldijiran/ Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "
18,Measuring the Biggest Smiles in MLB Using Computer Vision,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Thomas Nestico Follow -- Listen Share While downloading MLB official player headshots for a graphic I was working on, an idea dawned on me which felt both very fun and interesting: “Which player has the biggest smile in MLB?” I have had some experience with Computer Vision (CV) models before but have not applied it to baseball. This felt like the perfect project to try it out with, and the end goal was ridiculous enough that people should find it entertaining. All code provided is Python. GitHub’s Co-Pilot assisted with code writing. Thanks to MLBAM, accessing information about players is simple! The first step for gathering all MLB player headshots is to gather the IDs of all MLB players. This can be done with the MLB Stats API, which includes an endpoint for accessing all players in a given MLB affiliated league. The function get_players() returns a data frame containing all relevant information for MLB players during the current season. The next step in the process is to download each player’s official MLB headshot. These can be accessed directly from MLB.com via each player’s page. Here is an example of Andrew Abbott’s player page We are interested in his headshot, which is easily accessed on this page. Here is the link to his headshot. All MLB Official Headshots are differentiated by the player’s MLBAMID, also known as their Player ID. By changing the URL to include CJ Abrams Player ID instead of Abbott’s, we can get Abrams’ headshot. Since we can simply change the ID in each URL to get the player’s headshot, we can create a column in pandas which contains all headshot URLs Now that we have the URL for each headshot, we can download all the MLB headshots to a folder. To limit the amount of calls to MLB’s server, I suggest limiting the download time between images using time.sleep(). This function will download all the URLs and store them in a folder called “headshots”. We now have all MLB headshots! Now on to the Computer Vision! Using CV we can have a model which looks at each headshot and determine the location of facial features on each player. Thankfully, there is a public model available on GitHub which has done the legwork for us! Italo José created facial-landmarks-recognition which we can use for our task. Their model places landmarks on a person’s face to define facial features. For our project, we are looking just at the landmarks which make up the mouth. This function takes an image as an input and outputs an array of the mouth coordinates which the model defines. There was some trial and error involved in my process, mostly regarding the colour conversion used for the images. The conversion I ended up using was BGR to LAB (CIELAB) as it best dealt with players which have facial hair. This is a for loop which goes through each headshot and calls the measure_smile() function. We append the “mouth_points” of each player to a list called “smile_list” and then create a column in the original data frame with the mouth points. We are defining a smile as “the portion of a player’s mouth which is between their lips”. While that may be a mouthful, it is essentially the area of teeth which the model calculates. An example would better illustrate this. For this example, we are using Oakland Athletic’s Shortstop Nick Allen, who has a Player ID of 669397. This is the code which will plot the smile of Nick Allen. Landmarks 12 and onward define the inner portion of a person’s mouth. Looking good! The model accurately highlighted Nick Allen’s smile. While the smile isn’t fully captured, it is a good approximation. Now, to determine which players have the largest smiles, we need a method to calculate the polygons which make up their smile. The shoelace formula (also known as Gauss’s area formula) is an algorithm to calculate the area of a polygon, even irregular ones. We can calculate the area of each player’s “smile” using this formula and then determine which players have the biggest smile! This code creates a column which calculates the area of each smile. With the areas calculated, we can now determine which players have the biggest smiles in MLB. To easily compare smile sizes between players, we can create a metric which quantifies a smile in terms of the average MLB smile. “Plus” Metrics are a popular subset of metrics used in baseball, which quantify a batter’s start as a percentage of the MLB Average. For these metrics, 100 is considered MLB average and every value above and below 100 corresponds to a value greater than or less than MLB average. For example, a player with a 150 OPS+ has an OPS which is 50% greater than league average (This is a simplified example which does not account for League and Park Factors). Using this methodology, I have created SMILE+ which uses a player’s smile size as the metric of interest. The formula is: Here are the Top 10 Players in SMILE+ You can find the full leaderboards here: SMILE+ Leaderboards While we achieved an encouraging outcome, there were still a few issues regarding with how the model determined (or failed to determine) the landmarks on some players faces. The CV model was sometimes confused with beards, and the biggest offender was Sean Hjelle. His closed mouth had the model considering the top of his goatee as the bottom of his mouth, which spiked his SMILE+ all the way to 298. Specifically for Hjelle, I redrew his smile coordinates and his SMILE+ dropped to 3. The CV model sometimes had trouble distinguishing between players skin tones. If a player’s skin tone and lip colour were similar, there has a chance the model would not be able to locate a mouth and return an empty list of coordinates. The most prominent example of this case was for Jhonkensy Noel, who has one of the best smiles in baseball! I redrew his smile shape and his SMILE+ ended up ranking 1st. When a player had lips which were small, the model struggled to assign accurate mouth coordinates. Colten Brewer has a great smile, but unfortunately, the model did not do an accurate job capturing its size. These are only a handful of limitations and inaccuracies present in the model. While this was a fun project to undertake, I will leave any subsequent improvements to you! I undertook this project because it felt like a fun introduction into using Computer Vision, and it sure was! While the results do not provide much practical value, I learned a lot about CV and had a blast doing so. Anytime you want to compare the smiles of MLB players, know that there was a baseball nerd who created a metric to help you do that. I hope you enjoyed this article as much as I did writing it!

As an internet researcher specializing in communication and media studies, I am always interested in how technology companies construct rhetoric and release products to the public. Therefore, I started writing about the digital carbon footprint several years ago. If you remember, from 2020–2021, many of the largest technology companies (like Microsoft and Google) made carbon pledges to become carbon-neutral or net-zero in the next few decades. This news generated excitement and applause from many people for their efforts to address climate change. However, as a researcher, my initial thought upon seeing these pledges was how these companies would be held accountable for achieving carbon neutrality and what carbon neutrality even means within digital tools. faitheday.medium.com In my original Medium articles, I mentioned the importance of monitoring carbon pledges made by companies to see if they stay… -- -- 2 Writer, Creator, and Educator.

20,Linear Algebra Concepts Every Data Scientist Should Know,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Benedict Neo Follow bitgrit Data Science Publication -- 5 Listen Share Linear algebra is a bedrock for all data science and machine learning tasks. It is the language that transforms theoretical models into practical solutions. It embodies principles that allow algorithms to learn from data. They’re used for This article will look at some linear algebra concepts, visual explanations, and code examples. Let’s dive right in! Code → Deepnote Notebook Vector ∘ Unit vectorVector operations ∘ Vector addition ∘ Scalar multiplication ∘ Dot productVector space ∘ Null space (kernel) ∘ Span ∘ Basis ∘ Linear IndependenceMatrix ∘ Matrices as functions ∘ Linear Transformation ∘ Inverse Matrix ∘ Singular Matrix ∘ Identity matrix. ∘ Diagonal Matrix ∘ Orthogonal matrix ∘ Matrix multiplication ∘ Trace ∘ Determinant ∘ Rank ∘ Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues This is the fundamental building block of linear algebra. There are 3 ways to think of a vector. The first is the physics perspective: vectors are arrows pointing in space, defined by length and direction. Vectors on a flat plane are 2-dimensional, and those in the space we live in are 3-dimensional. The second is the computer science perspective: vectors are ordered lists of numbers. The length of this list determines the dimension. The third is the mathematician’s perspective: vectors can be anything where two vectors are added and multiplied by a number. A unit vector is a vector with a magnitude of 1. It is often used to represent the direction of a vector without regard to its magnitude. The addition of two vectors to form a new vector, component-wise. Scalar multiplication is the multiplication of a vector by a scalar (a number) that results in the vector with the same direction (or opposite if the scalar is negative) as the original vector but with a magnitude that is scaled by the absolute value of the scalar. Formally, it is the product of the Euclidian magnitudes of two vectors and the cosine of the angle between them, reflecting both the length of the vectors and their directional relationship. Intuitively, think of it as applying the directional growth of one vector to another or “How much push/energy is one vector giving to the other?”. The result is how much stronger we’ve made the original vector (positive, negative, or zero) If the dot product is 0, it tells us that the vectors are orthogonal. A fun analogy by betterexplained Imagine the red vector is your speed, and the blue vector is the orientation of the boost pad. Larger numbers = more power. The dot product is how much boost you will get. Using the equation, |a| is your incoming speed, |b| is the max boost, the percentage of boost you get is cos(𝛉), for an overall boost of |a| |b| cos(𝛉) A vector (or linear) space is any collection of vectors that can be added together and multiplied (“scaled”) by numbers, called scalars in this context. A list of axioms must be satisfied for V to be called a vector space. The null space is a set of vectors that, when multiplied by the matrix, results in the zero vector. It represents the solution to the equation Ax = 0, where A is the given matrix. Imagine a 2d space with two vectors; the null space of a matrix can be visualized as a subspace that collapses these vectors to the origin (zero vector) when multiplied by the matrix. The set of all possible vectors you can reach given a linear combination of a given pair of vectors, v and w, av + bw, and let a and b be all real numbers. For most pairs of vectors, it can reach every point in the 2d vector plane When the two vectors happen to line up, it is limited to the single line that passes through the origin. The idea of span underlies the idea of basis. The basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the entire vector space. This means every vector in the vector space can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vector. Think of them as the building blocks for all other vectors in the space. It’s helpful to think of a single vector as an arrow, but for a collection of vectors, think of it as points. Most pairs of basis vectors can span the entire two-dimensional sheet of space. A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vectors in the set can be written as a linear combination of others (e.g., a linear combination of x and y would be any expression that forms ax + by, where a and b are constants) Matrices are a way to organize inputs and operations in rows and columns. Here’s a matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns. They’re a mathematical tool that can solve problems in a structured manner. You can think of matrices as functions. Just as a Python function takes input parameters, processes them, and returns output, a matrix transformation transforms input vectors into output vectors through linear transformation. A linear transformation is a mapping V → W between two vector spaces that preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. In practical terms, applying a matrix A to a vector x to get another vector y (via the operation Ax = y) is a linear transformation. This is used heavily in data science: Below are a few forms of matrices A matrix, when multiplied by its inverse, results in the identity matrix. A singular matrix is a square matrix that does not have an inverse. This is equivalent to saying the matrix’s determinant is zero or its rank is less than its size. The identity matrix is a square matrix with values of one on the diagonals and zero everywhere else. It acts as a multiplicative identity in matrix multiplication, leaving any matrix unchanged by it, just like the number 1. A diagonal matrix is a square matrix where all entries outside the main diagonal are zero. It is used in finding eigenvalues, and for calculating the determinant. A square matrix with real elements is considered orthogonal if its transpose equals its inverse. Formally, a matrix A is orthogonal if AᵀA=AAᵀ = I, where I is the identity matrix. Geometrically, a matrix is orthogonal if its columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors, a.k.a. they are mutually perpendicular and have a magnitude of 1. Recall that two vectors are orthogonal if they are perpendicular to each other (90 degrees) and the dot product between them is 0. You use matrices to perform matrix multiplication. Here’s a nice visualization from An Intuitive Guide to Linear Algebra Imagine you’re pouring each input data through each operation. Here’s an example of this operation. After pouring into the operations, you get this. The input was a [3 x 2] matrix, and our operation matrix is [2 x 3]; the result is [2 x 3] [3 x 2 ] = [2 x 2]. The size of the input has to match the size of the operation. The trace of a matrix is the sum of all its diagonal elements. It is invariant under the change of basis and provides value information about the matrix, i.e., the trace is the sum of the eigenvalues of a matrix. Determinant is the size of the output transformation. If the input was the unit vector (area or volume of 1), the determinant is the size of the transformed area or volume. Take this matrix, for example. If the area of A was scaled by 6, the determinant of the transformation is 6. A negative determinant tells us that the entire space was flipped. A transformation of this is like turning a set of paper onto the other side. Notice how the orientation of the red and green axes was reversed. A determinant of 0 means the matrix is “destructive” and cannot be reversed. Similar to multiplying by zero, information is lost. Determinants can tell us whether a matrix is invertible if det(A) is 0, the inverse does not exist; the matrix is singular. The maximum number of linearly independent column/row vectors in a matrix. It represents the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows or columns. It also tells us the number of output dimensions after a linear transformation. When the output of a transformation is a single line (it is one-dimensional), we say the transformation has a rank of 1. If all vectors land on some two-dimensional plane, we say the transformation has a rank of 2. For a 2x2 matrix, a rank of 2 is the best that it can be. This is known as a full rank. It means the basis vectors can span the entire 2d space and the non-zero determinant. But for 3x3 matrices, a rank of 2 means it collapsed, but not as much as a rank of 1. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues represent the “axes” of transformation. Eigenvectors are inputs that don’t change direction after a linear transformation. Even though the direction doesn’t change, the size might. This size, the amount that the eigenvector is scaled up or down, is the eigenvalue. Think about when you spin a globe; every location faces a new direction except the poles. Their direction doesn’t change. Here’s a visual example of eigenvectors. Formally, for a matrix A and a vector v, if Av = λv, then λ is an eigenvalue, and v is an eigenvector of A. Anther way of saying this is the eigenvectors of a square matrix A are vectors for which matrix multiplication = scalar multiplication.

That is why we decided to build a two-step process called Retriever-Ranker: Let’s go back to our example: Ultimately, we decided to deploy this matching system in two phases: first by deploying a retriever that sits before our actual matching model (that acts as the ranker). This setup allows us to validate the scalability and performance of the retriever. Then we can develop a more complex ranker on top of it. At the time of writing, our new ranker is still in development, so let’s focus on the retriever deployment. At the heart of the Retriever’s efficiency is its bi-encoder structure. This setup allows for the independent encoding of freelancer and project information into high-dimensional vectors (called embeddings). The key advantage here is the pre-computability of these embeddings: Freelancer profiles can be encoded ahead of time and stored, ready to be compared against any new project that comes in. When a new project is posted, its details are encoded into a vector in real-time. This project vector is then compared against the precomputed freelancer vectors using a similarity measure, like cosine similarity. In order to build these embeddings, we needed to develop two models (one for freelancer profiles and another one for projects). The details of these models, developed by our data science team would require a dedicated article so we won’t cover that here. Instead, the main facts about them: Here is a 2D projection of 10 000 of freelancers in our latent space, colored by their Malt’s category. We can see that freelancers in the same category are close to each other: Once the models were ready, we had to think about the infrastructure to store the precomputed vectors and serve them efficiently. For these purposes, a vector database seemed to be the perfect solution. We quickly considered looking at vector database solutions in our architecture, as we identified three main benefits: In summary, the adoption of a vector database was a crucial step in the development of our new matching system. In 2022, this technology became very popular (especially for Generative AI related applications) and the number of actors on the market exploded. In the next section, we explain how we approached the selection of the database and evaluated the various options. Our selection of vector database technology was guided by a set of criteria, each reflecting a core need for the us: Is filtering absolutely necessary to be performed within the vector database? What about applying it before or after the semantic search? We benchmarked several vector databases, testing their performance, ANN quality, and filtering capabilities under conditions that mimicked our real-world use case. Some of the databases we evaluated included: Why didn’t you benchmark more solutions / <insert your favorite> vector database than just these three? In fact we took a look at other providers, including well-known players like Pinecone but we had to exclude them. That is mainly because of the filtering capabilities of the databases: our use case includes filtering on geo-spatial data (to recommend freelancers next to projects) and only few databases support this feature currently. About this benchmark: This benchmark revealed significant variations in performance and capabilities: After thorough evaluation, Qdrant emerged as the optimal choice for our system, offering the best blend of speed, accuracy, and functionality. Its ability to handle our specific demands for vector search and filtering (especially geo-spatial), combined with its scalability and performance, made it the clear winner in our selection process. The process of implementing and deploying our database of choice was crucial to ensure that the theoretical benefits of the vector database would translate into tangible improvements in the matching system’s performance and reliability. To maximize the availability and scalability, Qdrant has the capability to be deployed in cluster configuration. This setup involved multiple Qdrant nodes organized in a manner that ensures data is replicated and balanced across the cluster, providing both redundancy and efficient query processing. We decided to self-host the solution on our Kubernetes clusters. Qdrant team provides Docker image (encapsulating the database along with its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different development and production environments) and an Helm chart that contains the definition of all the needed Kubernetes objects, streamlining the deployment process, making it reproducible and scalable. Regarding the monitoring, Qdrant exposes its metrics in Prometheus/OpenMetrics format and we coupled this with Grafana to provide real-time insights into the health, performance, and availability of our Qdrant nodes, allowing us to quickly identify and address any issues. As a result of this work, we deployed our retriever-ranker architecture in 2023. We placed our new neural retriever, backed by the vector database, before the current matching model. This marked a significant milestone for our matching system. We saw a huge improvement in response times, with p95 latency dropping from tens of seconds (sometimes taking over a minute!) to a snappy 3 seconds at most. All this was achieved without sacrificing the quality of our recommendations, which was confirmed by an increase in the conversion of projects in our AB test. This performance improvement goes beyond technical success. It unlocks new possibilities for Malt, enabling us to recommend freelancers in near real-time, significantly enhancing the user experience. The validation of our embedding model and retriever-ranker architecture opens doors for continued exploration and future developments: Projects like the one presented in this article are never the work of just one person.

22,RFM Segmentation: Unleashing Customer Insights,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Vito Rihaldijiran Follow Towards Data Science -- 1 Listen Share The methods vary when we talk about customer segmentation. Well, it depends on what we aim to achieve, but the primary purpose of customer segmentation is to put customers in different kinds of groups according to their similarities. This method, in practical applications, will help businesses specify their market segments with tailored marketing strategies based on the information from the segmentation. RFM segmentation is one example of customer segmentation. RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary. This technique is prevalent in commercial businesses due to its straightforward yet powerful approach. According to its abbreviation, we can define each metric in RFM as follows: The workflow of RFM segmentation is relatively straightforward. First, we collect data about customer transactions in a selected period. Please ensure we already know when the customer is transacting, how many quantities of particular products the customer buys in each transaction, and how much money the customer spends. After that, we will do the scoring. There are so many thresholds available for us to consider, but how about we opt for a scale ranging from 1 to 5 to evaluate each —where 1 represents the lowest score while 5 stands for the highest score. In the final step, we combine the three scores to create customer segments. For example, the customer who has the highest RFM score (5 in recency, frequency, and monetary) is seen as loyal, while the customer with the lowest RFM score (1 in recency, frequency, and monetary) is seen as a churning user. In the following parts of the article, we will create an RFM segmentation utilizing a popular unsupervised learning technique known as K-Means. We don’t need to collect the data in this practical example because we already have the dataset. We will use the Online Retail II dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is licensed under CC BY 4.0 and eligible for commercial use. You can access the dataset for free through this link. The dataset has all the information regarding customer transactions in online retail businesses, such as InvoiceDate, Quantity, and Price. There are two files in the dataset, but we will use the “Year 2010–2011” version in this example. Now, let’s do the code. Step 1: Data Preparation The first step is we do the data preparation. We do this as follows: The data preparation process is essential because the segmentation will refer to the data we process in this step. After we load the libraries and load the data, we perform the following steps: The data will be look like this after this step: Step 2: Calculate & Scale RFM Metrics In this step, we’ll calculate each metric and scale those before the clustering part. We do this as follows: We divide this step into three parts: After we complete this step, the result in the RFM dataset will look like this: And the scaled dataset will look like this: Step 3: K-Means Clustering Now we come to the final step, K-Means Clustering. We do this by: The first part of this step is determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method. The method is wss or “within-cluster sum of squares”, which measures the compactness of the clusters. This method works by choosing the number of clusters at the point where the wss starts to diminish rapidly, and forming an “elbow.” The elbow diminishes at 4. The next part is we do the clustering. We specify 4 as the number of clusters and 25 as random sets of initial cluster centers and then choose the best one based on the lowest within-cluster sum of squares. Then, add it to the cluster to the RFM dataset. The visualization of the cluster can be seen below: Note that the sizes of the clusters in the plot are not directly related to the count of customers in each cluster. The visualization shows the spread of the data points in each cluster based on the scaled RFM scores (R_Score, F_Score, M_Score) rather than the number of customers. With running this code, the summary of RFM segmentation can be seen as follows: From the summary, we can get generate insights from each cluster. The suggestions will vary greatly. However, what I can think of if I were a Data Scientist in an online retail business is the following: Congrats! you already know how to conduct RFM Segmentation using K-Means, now it’s your turn to do the same way with your own dataset. -- -- 1 Towards Data Science Postgrad at ANU School of Computing // https://www.linkedin.com/in/vito-rihaldijiran/ Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "

26,What’s wrong with 3D printing? (and why we acquired Micronics),"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Dávid Lakatos Follow -- Listen Share It’s hard not to be distracted by all the noise in 3D printing. Companies that raised eye watering amounts of venture capital funding are sold at a fire sale value (over a $1B raised between their private and public life, sold for $185M) or declaring bankruptcy (raised over $200M during lifetime). These two examples are just from the last 7 days, but the struggles of the industry over the last few years have been well documented [1]. Formlabs is on a different path: growing, managed responsibly, but almost every day I get asked what I think is going to happen in our industry? Let’s break it down, I’ll focus on companies building and selling printers (OEMs). There are about 100–150 manufacturers of 3D printers out there, ranging from Kickstarter projects all the way to public companies that have been around for 30 years. A quick summary of their 2023 performance: It’s pretty obvious there is a problem here — $7B is really not a huge number, in the adjacent industry of drones, that went through the hype cycle at the same time, a single company (DJI) is rumored to be reaching close to this revenue! In 3D printing over 150 companies compete with each other for the same amount of revenue — the result is pretty disastrous. Of the public companies in 3D printing there is not a single one that is profitable (EBITDA %, last 12 months)! In fact, finding a profitable 3D printing company is extremely difficult. We are fortunate to be a standard stop for companies when they are thinking about getting acquired, so over the years we have seen a few dozen private companies and we know of <5 total companies that were ever profitable on an EBITDA basis. Based on what we saw, my estimate is that the current 3D printing companies have around a cumulative -30% EBITDA margin. So what will happen next? My two cents: If these predictions come true, the industry will jump from -30% to +15% EBITDA margin. What will not help — companies that are individually wildly unprofitable merging to find “synergies”. Unfortunately this is what we see in the market primarily today, instead of the path that seems to be the more obvious one: create more value for your customers. Companies need to focus on building products that people actually want to buy and can get value out of in the near term. Not over-hyped technologies that are years away from wide adoption, but the products that deliver obvious value (great price-performance ratio) today. This is what has driven every industrial technology boom in the past (cars, phones, computers, EVs…). Formlabs is a product company — we make leaps in performance and ease of use that delight our customers. We need strong builders to achieve this on our journey to create more value for our customers. It’s not enough to build a single good product, my job as a leader of Formlabs is to create the team and the culture (Formlabs DNA) that can continuously create these products. On the backdrop of all of this is why I am so excited to share that we are acquiring Micronics today. If you don’t know, Micronics is a tiny startup (literally two guys still at university) that has proven that making a <$10k SLS 3D printer is possible, by building a prototype and raising about $1.3M on Kickstarter. We are acquiring them because we (Formlabs + Micronics) want to bring more accessible, powerful SLS printers to the market and we believe we can get there together faster. Today Formlabs ships more than 50% of all SLS units in the world. While I am proud of this achievement anyone studying the history of any technology-driven industry knows that success brings more competition, and in turn even higher need to accelerate. What makes us so excited about Henry and Luke is that they embody the very people we make our products for. They live in the “flow of making” (Henry literally has a CNC machine in his dorm room) and the only limitation to what they are able to make is the limitations of the tools that they are using. It’s a huge inspiration for me to see what they have built under 2 years (and a healthy kick in the pants to remember that we can’t slow down). It makes me happy to see that 12 years in we are still singularly, maniacally invested in making better products (in stark contrast with the dysfunctional part of our industry).

27,Bad design is like a virus: design defects and latent failures,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Michael Parent Follow UX Collective -- Listen Share Designers usually talk about the usability of the product or interface, how well it performs, the intuition of its layout, and maybe even its performance towards some target or goal (like clicks!). However, designers shouldn’t focus just on these features alone. The propensity for a designed product or system to fail is a very important consideration for designers. This is often not thought of when discussing design and user experience. Those efforts focus on what the normal circumstances of use are, and then try to optimize the experience and performance under those conditions. These conditions are sometimes referred to as the optimal design domain (ODD). When the focus is on failures, we typically consider the circumstances and behaviors outside of the ODD. In fact, this is one of the chief ways to evaluate good design. By looking at how often a product of system fails and to what severity the result of the failure is says a lot about the goodness of the design. Looking outside the ODD, to consider non-routine circumstances, incorrect usage behavior, and design risks, can help create a more reliable and resilient design. When things go wrong we search for a causal explanation. And since things usually don’t go wrong, when they do the causal explanation usually focuses on the behavior of the users. More elegant explanations may also focus on system dynamics like and “states” of the system, but the focus follows intuition and remains on the events immediately preceding the failure. These are called active failures. Active failures are are exactly what we expect them to be; the errors, behaviors, settings, and choices that immediately cause a failure. However, this is not the only immediate cause of failure. There are other factors that lie in wait, dormant, but with the potential to reek havoc. These are called latent failures. Unlike the active failures, the consist of decisions and choices from managers, engineers, and designers. Latent failures occur months, sometimes years, before hand as the design choices were made and implemented into the system. In 2000, Human Performance expert, and psychologist James Reason introduced a framework for understanding system failures and to demonstrate the impact of latent errors. He called it the Swiss Cheese Model. The model is relatively straightforward. For any system, there are many layers that can stop a failure from occurring. These layers include management decisions, design, machine performance, user behavior, protocols, and safety features. In short, the Swiss Cheese Model is an end to end vignette of every factor that could possible contribute to an error. If any layer performs correctly, the failure is prevented from propagating. However, in the event that all the layers are penetrated, then the system failure is created. As an example of the application of this model, consider the HMS titanic. The tragedy is not just the result of not seeing an iceberg, but also includes management decisions such as the speed of the ship, the route taken, the time of year, and of course the material failure of the watertight compartments of the ship. Had any one of these things not been present, the tragedy would likely not have occurred. The Swiss Cheese Model has important implications for designers. By the logic of the model, good design can prevent all failures from occurring. If that’s not 100% true in practice, it’s certainly close. A good design can stymie a potential failure from ever propagating through an organiation. However, it is unlikely that a designer will be able to create a design that is so robust that it prevents any and all failures, especially those caused by circumstances outside of the ODD. How then should designers think about design for the prevention of failures and latent errors? One way is through something called the resident pathogen metaphor. A resident pathogen is a medical idea that explains the presence of about diseases in an organism. Simply stated, no one pathogen (bacteria, cancer cell, carcinogen, virus) causes a disease, but as the number of pathogens increases within the organism, so does the probability of having the disease. James Reason offers this metaphor as a constructive way of thinking about latent failures and design errors. Replace the pathogen with design defects and the organism with an organization. The better the design, the less likely a failure will result. Reason explains: “Latent failures are analogous to ‘resident pathogens’ within the human body, which combine with external factors (stress, toxic agencies, etc.). to bring about disease. Like cancers and cardiovascular disorders, accidents in complex, defended systems do not arise from single causes. They occur through the unforeseen (and often unforeseeable) concatenation of several distinct factors, each one necessary but singly insufficient to cause the catastrophic breakdown.” Using this metaphor as a guiding light, we can say learn a few things about the causes, impact, behavior and propagation latent failures. First, and most obvious, the likelihood of issues within a system increases as the number of pathogens (design defects) increases. Second, The more complex, coupled, and opaque a system is, the greater number of pathogens (design defects). This is true for several reasons. consider a company with siloed and secretive projects, like defense contractors. The designer herself may not have all the relevant details to create the best design. Next, complexity cannot be controlled, only managed. If a system is excessively complex, there are many interactions within the system that a unknown. Their effects are likewise, unknown. Lastly, excessive opaqueness and complexity are not great outputs of design. If a designer creates such an output, it is likely the case that many design considerations have slipped through the cracks. Third, activities that are more effective and profitable aim at the proactive identification and neutralization of these latent failures rather than ongoing prevention and detection of active failures. It’s better to prevent cancer than treat it. Fourth, it is impossible to see and address all possible triggers of failures. Though pathogenic risks may be assessed through system knowledge. In light of the existence of design defects and impending failures, what should be done? There are many options available to address the challenges. However, several of these options seem like good ideas on the surface, but which actually have little effect on the system and in some cases the exact opposite of the intended effect. The first remedy is user and operator training. This remedy is probably familiar to all readers. Usually, training is conducted as part of the user initiation process. New users and operators are taught how a particular system functions. These types of trainings may be carried out by a trained facilitator, a peer, or a subject matter expert. Each have their own pros and cons, but what’s more important here is that the focus of the training is almost always the same — the normal use and operation of the system. In short, training, especially when coupled with an introduction of the system focuses to train the operator on how to choose behaviors that keep the system within the ODD. This approach to mitigating the risk of latent failures is clearly faulty. As we’ve already noted in the Swiss Cheese Model, the impact of latent errors are most likely to occur exactly when the system is operating outside of the ODD. While it’s important to try to ensure normal operation as much as possible, it does little to address the risk of latent errors when the inevitably occur. Another technique which has prima facie merit is to detect and address design errors. This can have some impact, especially if it is done in a systematic way, like using a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) tool. The benefits of these tools are that they allow you to think about the way things could possibly go wrong and then determine effects and causes, forcing you to think more creatively. Nevertheless, it still remains difficult to think outside of the ODD paradigm. While a completed FMEA may significantly reduce the number of resident pathogens within a system, it still does nothing to improve the resilience, response and recovery in the event of failure. Why not just add a bunch of extra safe guards? If the issues of latent failures occur when the system is operating abnormally, let’s just add restrictions so that it is impossible to operate in these scenarios. This approach seems logical, but actually violates many of the principles noted above. whenever we create systems that are complex, opaque, and the mediate the relationship between operation and result, we are actually adding more pathogens to the system. Consider an example. The 737 MAX was a poorly designed aircraft. Larger engines were added onto an existing design of a fuselage to save time and money in the development and manufacture of the aircraft. To prevent issues of stalling and to keep the 737 MAX within the ODD a safeguard, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) software, was installed to prevent the nose from rising too high too fast. This is well known. What’s not well known is that additional safeguards that deactivate the MCAS including changing the angle of attack, or pulling the fuse of the MCAS. These safeguards were what emboldened Boeing to move forward with a poor design. In fact it was the MCAS safeguard itself which end up causing the two Boeing 737 Max Crashes (Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302), which killed 346 in total. Bad design is actually worsened by creating safeguards. Despite the common missteps of addressing latent failures, there are several remedies that can be offered to effectively stamp out their risks. Situation Based Training. Unlike traditional training which focuses on teaching users how to maintain the system to achieve a particular output, situation based training has a very different purpose. Its aim is to provide opportunities for operators to work through unfamiliar scenarios and crisis situations. Airline pilots are great examples of this discipline. In order to maintain their license, they must record several hours of flight simulator training. This simulation training is not just routine, but focuses on handling difficult scenarios like engine failures and cabin depressurization. These situation based trainings aim to reinforce rules and patterns of thinking that can aid in choosing the correct behavior. I’ve written much more about the different levels of cognition and problem solving previously on UX Collective. Simulation. Similar to situation based training, simulation provides opportunities to become more acquainted with fringe situations. Also like situation based training, simulations can be constructed in such a way that allows particular, infrequent circumstances to be evaluated extensively, sometimes with several thousands of trials. Simulation also holds value in that it offers exploration of system dynamics (Of which I’ve written about here) that can eliminate likely latent design flaws. Simulation can take many forms. Monte Carlo Simulations and Discrete Event Simulations are two of the most popular for modelling systems. However, for extensively complex systems, agent-based simulations can reveal even greater insights through the combination of situation based training and simulation. Conducttr, a crisis exercise simulation platform is an excellent example. By using a wide network of actors with different levels of controls, objectives, and boundaries, governments and private organizations can simulate crisis scenarios, revealing potential vulnerabilities. Error Handling. Another expert way of handling latent errors is to plan for them. Software design is a prominent user of this technique. With so many lines, so much complexity, and so many systems relying on the code, of course something will go wrong. Consider what Geek for Geeks says about this simple, common practice. Error handling in Programming is a fundamental aspect of programming that addresses the inevitable challenges associated with unexpected issues during code execution. The best practice of software engineers is to anticipate errors and create rules to handle the errors when they do occur. Adaptive Situational Modes (ASMs). ASMs are are procedures that are used to prevent errors from occurring when situations escalate towards the fringe and outside of the ODD. The procedures are best explained through example. Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) have some of the most critical jobs in the world. They are responsible for directing air traffic at different altitudes and on the ground, as well as maintaining schedules and above all safety. even one mistake can mean the lives of several hundred people. One way they manage the safety amidst varying environmental conditions, traffic, and fatigue is through ASMs. ATCs have pre-defined modes of operation for circumstances that are hazardous or affords errors more readily. During periods of high traffic volume, controllers may prioritize efficient spacing of the aircraft, and adjust normal separation standards. In adverse weather, ATCs may shift their focus on rerouting flights and managing holding patterns, an alternative approaches rather than ground traffic. If system or mechanical disruptions occur, ATCs have adaptive norms to switch and rely on alternative communication methods to ensure safety. There are several more examples within Air Traffic Control and other critical jobs and industries also use ASMs. A chief takeaway of ASMs is that the belief that failure is possible and even likely. They switch from normal modes of operation to special modes that don’t take the design specifications and parameters of the existing system for granted. As you may have noticed, good remedies rely almost entirely on the users and operators of the system as the last line of defense. In light of the Swiss Cheese Model, this makes sense. The latent errors cannot be detected and prevented. The system is in a state that is different than the ODD, the only thing left is for to wait for the active failure or correct behavior of the operator. “A point has been reached in the development of technology where the greatest dangers stem not so much from the breakdown of a major component or from isolated operator errors, as from the insidious accumulation of delayed-action human failures occurring primarily within the organizational and managerial sectors.” Reason makes this claim in 1990. If his point was true then, it’s certainly true now. Yet how often have our efforts been directed towards solving, let alone acknowledging this challenge. The best remedies of situation based training, simulation and adaptive situational modes are still not widely used. Even more absurd, is that there seems no real reason why they shouldn’t be. Latent errors are not just the failures of designers and engineers. They also include, among other things, management decisions, cultural norms, and even customer expectations. Nevertheless, designers play a vital role in propagating potential failures throughout a system. The chief way designers can reduce latent errors is through making simple, non-complex connections and relationships between systems. They can also bolster transparency in systems, especially between the actions of the end user and the results. Designers should also be aware of ways they can work cross-functionally to mitigate the impact and risk of latent errors. They out to advise end users, engineers, and stakeholders of some of the best practices in this area, while also warning them of the poor remedies and paradoxes discussed above. Since the time of Reason’s quote, we’ve seen the technological revolutions of the internet and smartphones. We now stand on another cusp of generative artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and green energy. Latent failures will continue to propagate, even in greater number as our technologies become more complex and opaque. We ought to strive to make systems that reduce the inherent resident pathogens, and work in multidisciplinary fashion to prepare ourselves for the impact of future latent failures. -- -- UX Collective Please follow me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/parent-michael/ Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "

31,What’s wrong with 3D printing? (and why we acquired Micronics),"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Dávid Lakatos Follow -- Listen Share It’s hard not to be distracted by all the noise in 3D printing. Companies that raised eye watering amounts of venture capital funding are sold at a fire sale value (over a $1B raised between their private and public life, sold for $185M) or declaring bankruptcy (raised over $200M during lifetime). These two examples are just from the last 7 days, but the struggles of the industry over the last few years have been well documented [1]. Formlabs is on a different path: growing, managed responsibly, but almost every day I get asked what I think is going to happen in our industry? Let’s break it down, I’ll focus on companies building and selling printers (OEMs). There are about 100–150 manufacturers of 3D printers out there, ranging from Kickstarter projects all the way to public companies that have been around for 30 years. A quick summary of their 2023 performance: It’s pretty obvious there is a problem here — $7B is really not a huge number, in the adjacent industry of drones, that went through the hype cycle at the same time, a single company (DJI) is rumored to be reaching close to this revenue! In 3D printing over 150 companies compete with each other for the same amount of revenue — the result is pretty disastrous. Of the public companies in 3D printing there is not a single one that is profitable (EBITDA %, last 12 months)! In fact, finding a profitable 3D printing company is extremely difficult. We are fortunate to be a standard stop for companies when they are thinking about getting acquired, so over the years we have seen a few dozen private companies and we know of <5 total companies that were ever profitable on an EBITDA basis. Based on what we saw, my estimate is that the current 3D printing companies have around a cumulative -30% EBITDA margin. So what will happen next? My two cents: If these predictions come true, the industry will jump from -30% to +15% EBITDA margin. What will not help — companies that are individually wildly unprofitable merging to find “synergies”. Unfortunately this is what we see in the market primarily today, instead of the path that seems to be the more obvious one: create more value for your customers. Companies need to focus on building products that people actually want to buy and can get value out of in the near term. Not over-hyped technologies that are years away from wide adoption, but the products that deliver obvious value (great price-performance ratio) today. This is what has driven every industrial technology boom in the past (cars, phones, computers, EVs…). Formlabs is a product company — we make leaps in performance and ease of use that delight our customers. We need strong builders to achieve this on our journey to create more value for our customers. It’s not enough to build a single good product, my job as a leader of Formlabs is to create the team and the culture (Formlabs DNA) that can continuously create these products. On the backdrop of all of this is why I am so excited to share that we are acquiring Micronics today. If you don’t know, Micronics is a tiny startup (literally two guys still at university) that has proven that making a <$10k SLS 3D printer is possible, by building a prototype and raising about $1.3M on Kickstarter. We are acquiring them because we (Formlabs + Micronics) want to bring more accessible, powerful SLS printers to the market and we believe we can get there together faster. Today Formlabs ships more than 50% of all SLS units in the world. While I am proud of this achievement anyone studying the history of any technology-driven industry knows that success brings more competition, and in turn even higher need to accelerate. What makes us so excited about Henry and Luke is that they embody the very people we make our products for. They live in the “flow of making” (Henry literally has a CNC machine in his dorm room) and the only limitation to what they are able to make is the limitations of the tools that they are using. It’s a huge inspiration for me to see what they have built under 2 years (and a healthy kick in the pants to remember that we can’t slow down). It makes me happy to see that 12 years in we are still singularly, maniacally invested in making better products (in stark contrast with the dysfunctional part of our industry).

32,Bad design is like a virus: design defects and latent failures,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Michael Parent Follow UX Collective -- Listen Share Designers usually talk about the usability of the product or interface, how well it performs, the intuition of its layout, and maybe even its performance towards some target or goal (like clicks!). However, designers shouldn’t focus just on these features alone. The propensity for a designed product or system to fail is a very important consideration for designers. This is often not thought of when discussing design and user experience. Those efforts focus on what the normal circumstances of use are, and then try to optimize the experience and performance under those conditions. These conditions are sometimes referred to as the optimal design domain (ODD). When the focus is on failures, we typically consider the circumstances and behaviors outside of the ODD. In fact, this is one of the chief ways to evaluate good design. By looking at how often a product of system fails and to what severity the result of the failure is says a lot about the goodness of the design. Looking outside the ODD, to consider non-routine circumstances, incorrect usage behavior, and design risks, can help create a more reliable and resilient design. When things go wrong we search for a causal explanation. And since things usually don’t go wrong, when they do the causal explanation usually focuses on the behavior of the users. More elegant explanations may also focus on system dynamics like and “states” of the system, but the focus follows intuition and remains on the events immediately preceding the failure. These are called active failures. Active failures are are exactly what we expect them to be; the errors, behaviors, settings, and choices that immediately cause a failure. However, this is not the only immediate cause of failure. There are other factors that lie in wait, dormant, but with the potential to reek havoc. These are called latent failures. Unlike the active failures, the consist of decisions and choices from managers, engineers, and designers. Latent failures occur months, sometimes years, before hand as the design choices were made and implemented into the system. In 2000, Human Performance expert, and psychologist James Reason introduced a framework for understanding system failures and to demonstrate the impact of latent errors. He called it the Swiss Cheese Model. The model is relatively straightforward. For any system, there are many layers that can stop a failure from occurring. These layers include management decisions, design, machine performance, user behavior, protocols, and safety features. In short, the Swiss Cheese Model is an end to end vignette of every factor that could possible contribute to an error. If any layer performs correctly, the failure is prevented from propagating. However, in the event that all the layers are penetrated, then the system failure is created. As an example of the application of this model, consider the HMS titanic. The tragedy is not just the result of not seeing an iceberg, but also includes management decisions such as the speed of the ship, the route taken, the time of year, and of course the material failure of the watertight compartments of the ship. Had any one of these things not been present, the tragedy would likely not have occurred. The Swiss Cheese Model has important implications for designers. By the logic of the model, good design can prevent all failures from occurring. If that’s not 100% true in practice, it’s certainly close. A good design can stymie a potential failure from ever propagating through an organiation. However, it is unlikely that a designer will be able to create a design that is so robust that it prevents any and all failures, especially those caused by circumstances outside of the ODD. How then should designers think about design for the prevention of failures and latent errors? One way is through something called the resident pathogen metaphor. A resident pathogen is a medical idea that explains the presence of about diseases in an organism. Simply stated, no one pathogen (bacteria, cancer cell, carcinogen, virus) causes a disease, but as the number of pathogens increases within the organism, so does the probability of having the disease. James Reason offers this metaphor as a constructive way of thinking about latent failures and design errors. Replace the pathogen with design defects and the organism with an organization. The better the design, the less likely a failure will result. Reason explains: “Latent failures are analogous to ‘resident pathogens’ within the human body, which combine with external factors (stress, toxic agencies, etc.). to bring about disease. Like cancers and cardiovascular disorders, accidents in complex, defended systems do not arise from single causes. They occur through the unforeseen (and often unforeseeable) concatenation of several distinct factors, each one necessary but singly insufficient to cause the catastrophic breakdown.” Using this metaphor as a guiding light, we can say learn a few things about the causes, impact, behavior and propagation latent failures. First, and most obvious, the likelihood of issues within a system increases as the number of pathogens (design defects) increases. Second, The more complex, coupled, and opaque a system is, the greater number of pathogens (design defects). This is true for several reasons. consider a company with siloed and secretive projects, like defense contractors. The designer herself may not have all the relevant details to create the best design. Next, complexity cannot be controlled, only managed. If a system is excessively complex, there are many interactions within the system that a unknown. Their effects are likewise, unknown. Lastly, excessive opaqueness and complexity are not great outputs of design. If a designer creates such an output, it is likely the case that many design considerations have slipped through the cracks. Third, activities that are more effective and profitable aim at the proactive identification and neutralization of these latent failures rather than ongoing prevention and detection of active failures. It’s better to prevent cancer than treat it. Fourth, it is impossible to see and address all possible triggers of failures. Though pathogenic risks may be assessed through system knowledge. In light of the existence of design defects and impending failures, what should be done? There are many options available to address the challenges. However, several of these options seem like good ideas on the surface, but which actually have little effect on the system and in some cases the exact opposite of the intended effect. The first remedy is user and operator training. This remedy is probably familiar to all readers. Usually, training is conducted as part of the user initiation process. New users and operators are taught how a particular system functions. These types of trainings may be carried out by a trained facilitator, a peer, or a subject matter expert. Each have their own pros and cons, but what’s more important here is that the focus of the training is almost always the same — the normal use and operation of the system. In short, training, especially when coupled with an introduction of the system focuses to train the operator on how to choose behaviors that keep the system within the ODD. This approach to mitigating the risk of latent failures is clearly faulty. As we’ve already noted in the Swiss Cheese Model, the impact of latent errors are most likely to occur exactly when the system is operating outside of the ODD. While it’s important to try to ensure normal operation as much as possible, it does little to address the risk of latent errors when the inevitably occur. Another technique which has prima facie merit is to detect and address design errors. This can have some impact, especially if it is done in a systematic way, like using a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) tool. The benefits of these tools are that they allow you to think about the way things could possibly go wrong and then determine effects and causes, forcing you to think more creatively. Nevertheless, it still remains difficult to think outside of the ODD paradigm. While a completed FMEA may significantly reduce the number of resident pathogens within a system, it still does nothing to improve the resilience, response and recovery in the event of failure. Why not just add a bunch of extra safe guards? If the issues of latent failures occur when the system is operating abnormally, let’s just add restrictions so that it is impossible to operate in these scenarios. This approach seems logical, but actually violates many of the principles noted above. whenever we create systems that are complex, opaque, and the mediate the relationship between operation and result, we are actually adding more pathogens to the system. Consider an example. The 737 MAX was a poorly designed aircraft. Larger engines were added onto an existing design of a fuselage to save time and money in the development and manufacture of the aircraft. To prevent issues of stalling and to keep the 737 MAX within the ODD a safeguard, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) software, was installed to prevent the nose from rising too high too fast. This is well known. What’s not well known is that additional safeguards that deactivate the MCAS including changing the angle of attack, or pulling the fuse of the MCAS. These safeguards were what emboldened Boeing to move forward with a poor design. In fact it was the MCAS safeguard itself which end up causing the two Boeing 737 Max Crashes (Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302), which killed 346 in total. Bad design is actually worsened by creating safeguards. Despite the common missteps of addressing latent failures, there are several remedies that can be offered to effectively stamp out their risks. Situation Based Training. Unlike traditional training which focuses on teaching users how to maintain the system to achieve a particular output, situation based training has a very different purpose. Its aim is to provide opportunities for operators to work through unfamiliar scenarios and crisis situations. Airline pilots are great examples of this discipline. In order to maintain their license, they must record several hours of flight simulator training. This simulation training is not just routine, but focuses on handling difficult scenarios like engine failures and cabin depressurization. These situation based trainings aim to reinforce rules and patterns of thinking that can aid in choosing the correct behavior. I’ve written much more about the different levels of cognition and problem solving previously on UX Collective. Simulation. Similar to situation based training, simulation provides opportunities to become more acquainted with fringe situations. Also like situation based training, simulations can be constructed in such a way that allows particular, infrequent circumstances to be evaluated extensively, sometimes with several thousands of trials. Simulation also holds value in that it offers exploration of system dynamics (Of which I’ve written about here) that can eliminate likely latent design flaws. Simulation can take many forms. Monte Carlo Simulations and Discrete Event Simulations are two of the most popular for modelling systems. However, for extensively complex systems, agent-based simulations can reveal even greater insights through the combination of situation based training and simulation. Conducttr, a crisis exercise simulation platform is an excellent example. By using a wide network of actors with different levels of controls, objectives, and boundaries, governments and private organizations can simulate crisis scenarios, revealing potential vulnerabilities. Error Handling. Another expert way of handling latent errors is to plan for them. Software design is a prominent user of this technique. With so many lines, so much complexity, and so many systems relying on the code, of course something will go wrong. Consider what Geek for Geeks says about this simple, common practice. Error handling in Programming is a fundamental aspect of programming that addresses the inevitable challenges associated with unexpected issues during code execution. The best practice of software engineers is to anticipate errors and create rules to handle the errors when they do occur. Adaptive Situational Modes (ASMs). ASMs are are procedures that are used to prevent errors from occurring when situations escalate towards the fringe and outside of the ODD. The procedures are best explained through example. Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) have some of the most critical jobs in the world. They are responsible for directing air traffic at different altitudes and on the ground, as well as maintaining schedules and above all safety. even one mistake can mean the lives of several hundred people. One way they manage the safety amidst varying environmental conditions, traffic, and fatigue is through ASMs. ATCs have pre-defined modes of operation for circumstances that are hazardous or affords errors more readily. During periods of high traffic volume, controllers may prioritize efficient spacing of the aircraft, and adjust normal separation standards. In adverse weather, ATCs may shift their focus on rerouting flights and managing holding patterns, an alternative approaches rather than ground traffic. If system or mechanical disruptions occur, ATCs have adaptive norms to switch and rely on alternative communication methods to ensure safety. There are several more examples within Air Traffic Control and other critical jobs and industries also use ASMs. A chief takeaway of ASMs is that the belief that failure is possible and even likely. They switch from normal modes of operation to special modes that don’t take the design specifications and parameters of the existing system for granted. As you may have noticed, good remedies rely almost entirely on the users and operators of the system as the last line of defense. In light of the Swiss Cheese Model, this makes sense. The latent errors cannot be detected and prevented. The system is in a state that is different than the ODD, the only thing left is for to wait for the active failure or correct behavior of the operator. “A point has been reached in the development of technology where the greatest dangers stem not so much from the breakdown of a major component or from isolated operator errors, as from the insidious accumulation of delayed-action human failures occurring primarily within the organizational and managerial sectors.” Reason makes this claim in 1990. If his point was true then, it’s certainly true now. Yet how often have our efforts been directed towards solving, let alone acknowledging this challenge. The best remedies of situation based training, simulation and adaptive situational modes are still not widely used. Even more absurd, is that there seems no real reason why they shouldn’t be. Latent errors are not just the failures of designers and engineers. They also include, among other things, management decisions, cultural norms, and even customer expectations. Nevertheless, designers play a vital role in propagating potential failures throughout a system. The chief way designers can reduce latent errors is through making simple, non-complex connections and relationships between systems. They can also bolster transparency in systems, especially between the actions of the end user and the results. Designers should also be aware of ways they can work cross-functionally to mitigate the impact and risk of latent errors. They out to advise end users, engineers, and stakeholders of some of the best practices in this area, while also warning them of the poor remedies and paradoxes discussed above. Since the time of Reason’s quote, we’ve seen the technological revolutions of the internet and smartphones. We now stand on another cusp of generative artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and green energy. Latent failures will continue to propagate, even in greater number as our technologies become more complex and opaque. We ought to strive to make systems that reduce the inherent resident pathogens, and work in multidisciplinary fashion to prepare ourselves for the impact of future latent failures. -- -- UX Collective Please follow me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/parent-michael/ Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "

Using his narrative as a jumping off point, he explores the research behind why it’s so difficult to focus. In the process, he uncovers the larger systems driving our collective loss of attention, prompting the reader to understand our difficulties not as personal failures but as the result of larger societal forces that we must resist collectively. I came to Hari’s book as part of my own soul-searching about technology’s role in my life. I’m a stay-at-home mom and professor, so my attention is pulled in a thousand different ways every day by e-mail, housework, papers to grade, and preschoolers yelling “mommy!” I hoped that Hari’s book would help me manage my online life and hone my ability to attend to what is most important. -- -- 2 Books Are Our Superpower Humanities professor, homeschool mom, and language learner living life in an intercultural family in Southern California.

36,Why Tech Workers Are Fleeing Germany — A Reality Check,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Jan Kammerath Follow -- 178 Share Over the past months and years I have seen a number of friends and colleagues leave Germany for good. Some of them were native Germans, others were expats from all over the world, from India, from other EU countries, America and Asia. All of them had one thing in common: They’ve had enough of Germany and left. Being a native German myself, born in Berlin in 1985, I wondered what made highly qualified workers say “No, Thank you” to my beloved home country. After talking to friends, coworkers, business partners and beergarden acquaintances, I thought I’d write it up. One of my friends said before leaving “People should be told before they come here”. At first I was hesitant to write this up as my fellow countrymen and women often develop a form of false patriotism. It ends up in denial of problems that are very real for expats coming to Germany and thus in a number of heated comments. They often bring up arguments like “But you also get all the services for your taxes” and the like. That of course isn’t very helpful to anyone and we’ll do a reality check of some of these claims in this article. What struck me the most is the belief that you can easily make 6-digit salaries in Germany, well above €150,000 annually.

And to me anyway, it’s nothing short of ironic that the push to bring employees back to the office is going to go out with a whimper instead of a bang.

Now that I am a parent myself, I recognize how difficult it is to recreate this kind of childhood for my own kids. In Childhood Unplugged, Katherine Johnson Martinko holds up this old-fashioned vision of childhood to motivate parents to cut down on screen time in their kids’ lives. She bases her message not only on the negative effects of technology but also on the richer experiences children can have offline. Martinko, a former editor for the sustainability website Treehugger, has made her career writing about free-range parenting, environmentalism, and analog living. Throughout the book, Martinko weaves in the story of her own life as a working mother and how she and her husband have implemented these practices in their own lives. Rather than focus on what needs to be cut out, Martinko instead highlights what can be gained through a screen-free approach. In her introduction, she lists her goals as a parent: I want my children to have a beautiful, imaginative… -- -- 5 Books Are Our Superpower Humanities professor, homeschool mom, and language learner living life in an intercultural family in Southern California.

41,the peace of not knowing,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in keng Follow -- 131 Listen Share Why do we feel the need to know everything? There is a peculiar serenity in the spaces between what we know and what we don’t. We spend so much time chasing answers, yearning to know every detail, every outcome. We feel that we should know everything, even the things that are not in our control. Perhaps it’s our way of grasping for control in a world that often feels chaotic. We think that knowing will shield us from the things that might hurt us — a hope that if we can predict and understand every aspect of life, we can protect ourselves from disappointment and pain. By trying to grasp the ungraspable, we exhaust ourselves and miss the beauty of simply experiencing life as it comes. It’s okay not to have all the answers. It’s okay to wonder and dream about what could be, and to let the unknown be a source of hope rather than fear. Because life is a world full of uncertainties. No one knows what will happen next, or what will become of the future. Life becomes less about having all the answers and more about cherishing the questions and the experiences that come with them. In those moments of doubt and confusion, remember that not every answer needs to be found. Not every question needs a response. It’s okay to pause, to sit with the uncertainty, and let it unfold in its own time. Life has a way of revealing its secrets, but only when we are ready to listen. There’s a peace in not knowing. It allows us to not need every answer in life. It invites us to trust in the process, to surrender to the flow of life’s currents, knowing that even in the absence of clarity, we are guided by Him — the Lord who will never fail us. May you have the courage to let go of the need to control every aspect of your life. Embrace the mystery, and let it guide you to places you never imagined.

42,the scariest things during midnights are the cruel realizations and the chaos of adulthood.,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in hae Follow -- Listen Share Midnights are moments of truth, when the chaos of adulthood and the cruelty of reality hit us like a ton of bricks.

This is when the weight of adulthood and the reality of our lives come crashing down on us. It’s a relatable feeling, isn’t it? Midnight is a time when my mind is most active, and I start to overthink everything. That’s when I become more aware of the responsibilities and stress that come with adulthood. I start to worry about my future, my finances, my relationships, and all the other things that keep me up at night. And sometimes, I realize how cruel and unfair the world can be. It’s a scary and chaotic mix of emotions, and it’s not easy to shake off. It feels like the weight of the world settles on my shoulders in the dead of night. I’m suddenly faced with the reality of my situation, and it can be pretty overwhelming. The worst part is, there’s no escape from it. I can’t just hit pause and take a break from it all. I have to face it head-on, one midnight at a time. It’s a constant battle with my thoughts, worries, and fears. I lie there, in the darkness, staring at the ceiling, trying to make sense of it all. The silence of the night only makes it worse, as the chaos in my mind fills up the empty space around me. It’s a time when I missed the simplicity and innocence of childhood when I was free from care and responsibility. But I can’t go back, I can’t turn back the clock. I can only try to make the best of my current situation. Maybe, just maybe, I can learn to find a sense of peace and acceptance in the chaos of adulthood. After all, it’s not all bad. I have experienced so much, learned so much, and grown so much. During these quiet moments, I try to remind myself of the strength I’ve gained. I’ve faced challenges and overcome obstacles. Each midnight filled with fear and uncertainty has also been a time of reflection and growth. It’s a part of life that I need to accept and navigate. The struggle of adulthood isn’t something to fear but something to embrace. It’s in these moments of reflection that I find clarity. I learned more about myself, my strengths, and my resilience. These realizations, though harsh, are also enlightening. Maybe one day, I’ll look back at these midnights and see them not as moments of fear and uncertainty, but as periods of growth and self-discovery. It’s all part of the journey, isn’t it? The good, the bad, the scary, and the chaotic. It’s what makes life interesting. As I face the midnight thoughts and the chaos of adulthood, I remind myself that each day is a new opportunity. The weight of the world may feel heavy, but it’s also a sign of the life I’m living and the progress I’m making. So, while midnights can be scary and overwhelming, they are also a time for me to reflect, grow, and find strength within myself.

49,the art of disappearing,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in remi ;༊ Follow -- 951 Listen Share Self-isolation has always been my coping mechanism. I often get the urge to disappear from everyone without a trace. It’s not that I don’t enjoy the company of others, but there are moments when the weight of the world becomes too heavy, and all I want is to be on my own. There’s something strangely comforting about the idea of disappearing. It’s not about running away from problems; rather, it’s about finding a quiet place where I can simply be. In those moments, I long to ignore everyone and everything around me — to escape into my own little world. It’s a way for me to protect my sanity and maintain my emotional well-being. Disappearing is my way of reclaiming my peace of mind in a world that constantly demands our attention and drowns us with noise. When I disappear, I have the freedom to do as I please — reading a book, taking a long walk, sleeping, or indulging in my favorite hobbies without the pressure of social interaction. There’s a certain joy in being able to exist without the need for validation from others. In embracing the art of disappearing, I’ve come to understand the importance of self-care and self-awareness. It’s about listening to my own needs and setting my boundaries, even if it means stepping away from the chaos of everyday life. Disappearing allows me to recharge, to reflect, and to show up stronger than before. Yes, I disappear — a lot. And I’ve come to accept that it’s okay. In fact, it’s essential for my mental and emotional well-being. It’s a reminder that amidst the hustle and bustle of life, it’s okay to press pause and to retreat into the comfort of solitude. But beneath this desire to vanish lies a deeper yearning — not to disappear, but to be found. It’s not a desire to be forgotten, but rather a longing to be sought after, to be understood and accepted for who I am. “Sometimes, you think you want to disappear, but all you really want is to be found.” So, even though I may seem like I want to run away, what I really want is for someone to find me, to rescue me from the darkness I’ve always been, to show me the light, and to let me feel that I am not alone. I may have lived with the art of disappearing, but I also hope that someday, someone will find me. -- -- 951 – a girl who’s trying to be free Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "

Are you nervous?"" You used to ask me these things back then. Back then when you still cared. But what happened? Why did everything suddenly change? It feels like ages since I heard those words from you. I miss that care, that concern. I miss the way you used to notice even the smallest changes in me. It made me feel seen, understood, and loved. Now, it feels like you don’t notice anything anymore. I feel like a ghost to you. I could be screaming inside, but you wouldn’t hear. I could be falling apart, but you wouldn’t see. Please, ask me what's wrong. I miss when you cared. I miss feeling like I mattered to you. I remember the times you would catch the slightest hint of sadness in my eyes, the subtle shake in my voice, or the slight hunch in my shoulders. You were so attuned to me, and your questions were like a lifeline, pulling me out of the depths of my own despair. Suddenly, everything changed, your silence is deafening. It’s as if a wall has grown between us, a wall built from all the unasked questions and all the unspoken words. Every day that passes without your concern feels like a weight pressing down on me, a reminder of how things have changed. I wonder if you realize how much your absence hurts. I wonder if you see how your indifference has carved a hollow space in my heart. I long for the days when you cared enough to ask, when you loved me enough to see. So here I am, holding onto the hope that you might notice again. That you might look at me and see the struggle behind my forced smiles. That you might remember the person I used to be and the connection we once shared. Please, ask me what's wrong. I miss when you cared.

If she took me, it wouldn’t seem like she had a gambling problem. Back then, she bothered with appearances. Later, we knew Mom’s habits so she stopped hiding them. So, Happy birthday, me!

Uttering a word is an act of rebellion for them. In eighteen years of my life, I rarely feel heard or understood, or maybe I haven’t totally felt it yet in this household. And no matter how I push my words to be valuable, it’s still the opposite that they trust. In every disagreement, it always ends up with me breaking down in my room until I fall asleep with my pillow soaked by my tears. It is my dream — to be heard and to be understood.

55,,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Farhan Rosman Follow -- Listen Share The Weight of the World: Modern Men’s Struggles with Financial Responsibility In today’s fast-paced world, men often find themselves under immense pressure to fulfil multiple roles. As a financial consultant, I’ve seen firsthand the struggles many husbands and fathers face. The expectations are high — to be the primary provider, a supportive partner, a dedicated father, and often a dutiful son to ageing parents. It’s no wonder many men are feeling the strain, especially when financial issues come into play. The Modern Provider The traditional role of men as the primary providers has evolved but hasn’t disappeared. In many Asian families, men still feel the weight of being the primary breadwinner. This responsibility can be daunting, especially in a world where job security is no longer guaranteed and the cost of living keeps rising. The desire to provide a comfortable life for their family can lead to immense pressure, and the fear of not meeting these expectations can be crippling. Supporting Ageing Parents In our Asian culture, where filial piety is highly valued, many of the men I’ve met find themselves in the position of supporting their ageing retired parents. Dealing with this situation can be especially difficult when ageing parents have not adequately planned for their retirement or have made unfortunate financial choices. The reality of having to step in and provide financial support, especially when old parents are dealing with medical issues like stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer’s or heart-related ailments, can add a layer of stress. It’s not just about the money — it’s about the emotional toll of seeing your parents struggle and feeling responsible for their well-being. After all, many of us feel grateful and indebted for them raising us since we were born. Juggling Multiple Roles Our modern married man is expected to wear many hats. Beyond being just a provider, there’s the role of being a confidant, protector, and leader. This is in addition to being a supportive-loving-understanding partner and an engaged father to our children. For most of us, having a working spouse also means we also have to share the role of being a homemaker. I understand that balancing these roles can be incredibly stressful for many men. It’s common to feel like we’re constantly falling short, especially with the added pressure from social media where we often compare ourselves to other seemingly perfect couples. This pressure to succeed in every aspect of life can very likely lead to burnout and mental health issues like anxiety and depression. It’s unfortunate that these issues often go unspoken due to societal expectations around masculinity. Financial Stress It’s quite common for many of the men I work with to experience financial stress. The weight of mortgages, bills, loans, school fees, daily expenses, and unexpected medical bills can be incredibly overwhelming. The fear of not being able to provide for their families or failing to meet financial obligations often keeps them up at night. Many suffer in silence, feeling isolated and unsure of where to turn for support. Breaking the Silence I strongly believe it is so important for men to realise that they are not alone in their struggles. Speaking out and seeking support is not a sign of weakness but a true demonstration of strength. Financial planning can play a significant role in alleviating some of this stress. As a financial consultant, I truly encourage men to take a proactive approach to their finances. This includes: 1. Creating a Budget: Understanding where your money is going can help you identify areas for cutting back and saving. 2. Setting Financial Goals: Short-term and long-term goals can provide a sense of direction and purpose. 3. Emergency Fund: Having a safety net can provide peace of mind in case of unexpected expenses. 4. Retirement Planning: It’s never too early to start planning for retirement. Ensuring you have a solid plan in place can prevent future financial strain. We don’t want to repeat the same mistakes as some of our parents. 5. Insurance: Adequate health and life insurance can protect your family in case of unforeseen circumstances such as premature death, disability and critical illness. 6. Education Planning: Ensuring that your children have access to quality education can significantly impact their future opportunities. By planning and saving for their education early on, you can alleviate the stress of funding their studies when the time comes, and avoid taking on burdensome debt. 7. Legacy Planning: Legacy planning involves making arrangements to pass on your wealth and assets in a way that aligns with your values and wishes. This can include creating a will and setting up trusts. It’s an important step to ensure that your loved ones are taken care of and that your financial legacy is preserved. Conclusion I understand that the expectations placed on men nowadays can be enormous, and the financial pressures overwhelming. However, with the proper support and planning, it’s possible to navigate these challenges. It’s important to remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, and there are resources available to assist in managing both financial and emotional stress. After more than ten years in this industry, having spoken to numerous men dealing with these same challenges, I truly understand the complexities and pressures involved. I’m not just a financial consultant, but someone who is also navigating these struggles personally. I know firsthand how crucial it is to take a proactive approach to financial planning. It’s important to understand that there are professionals who can offer assistance. Financial consultants can provide personalised advice to help improve your financial situation, while mental health counsellors can provide support in coping with the emotional and psychological pressures that accompany these responsibilities. I realise that many of us have very busy lives and may not have the capacity to address these issues on our own. This is where these professionals can make a real impact — seeking help from the right sources can truly make a difference. Remember, by taking a proactive approach to financial planning, men can ease some of their burdens and create a stable and secure future for their families. It’s all about finding balance and understanding that you don’t have to bear the weight of the world on your shoulders alone. Please don’t hesitate to reach out, speak up, and take the first step towards financial peace of mind. -- -- What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us. - Oliver W.

62,But who takes care of the eldest daughter?,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in keng Follow -- 195 Listen Share To be the eldest in a family means grieving for the child you never got to be. The need to grow up fast, to be mature because your younger siblings need you. It’s like being a mother while still a kid yourself. Because I’m the older one, I need to fully understand them and make sacrifices because, after all, I get it — I am the oldest. I need to be strong enough to handle all the responsibilities that are placed on me. I stay up late helping them with homework, ensuring everyone’s projects are done perfectly. I listen to their worries, their fears, while keeping mine locked away. I am the mediator during fights, the one who picks up the pieces and makes peace. I am the cheerleader, always encouraging, always believing in their dreams even when mine are put on hold. I am expected to set an example and bear the weight of the family’s expectations. I need to excel in school because I will be the one ensuring they get an education later on. I balance school, chores, and emotional support, rarely getting a moment to breathe. I carry the silent stress of keeping everything together. And while everyone turns to me, who do I turn to? Even the strongest hearts can break under the weight of unspoken burdens. While I’m there for everyone else, who is there for me? Who sees the tears I hide, the exhaustion in my eyes, the silent wish for someone to ask if I’m okay? Who comforts me when I’m weary from always being the strong one? It’s easy to forget that even the eldest needs care and understanding, someone to lean on when the burden becomes too much. It’s ironic, isn’t it? The one who cares for everyone else is often the one who feels the most alone. You put on a brave face and you keep going because that’s what you’re supposed to do. But who looks out for you? Who takes care of the eldest daughter when she needs someone to lean on? You are more than the role you’ve been given, more than the responsibilities that weigh you down. You deserve to be cared for, to be held, to be understood. And if you ever feel like it’s all too much, remember that you, too, need love and support. You are worthy of the same care and kindness you give to everyone else.

It was a long project. We had not anticipated the scale of the place when compared to our last two much smaller renovations. Everything was twice as large, took three times as long and was four times the cost. This place was grinding us down as it slowly dawned on us that we had bitten off more than we could chew.

Not because I had no desire for a kitten. I really did want an orange and white kitten. But, because my husband, the non-animal person in the house, would never take the kids to pick out an animal on his own. Would he? Hours later, the boys returned. I could tell by the smiles on their faces that they were quite pleased with themselves. My husband sent the oldest to grab my surprise. It was the cutest, little orange and white tabby kitten. Short hair, round face, loving eyes. Exactly what I had pictured. The boys excitedly told me about their visit to the animal shelter. How they sat down in the kitten room and this particular kitten snuggled right up. They knew she was the one for me. But that was just the first part of the story. My other son scurried off and returned with something small cradled in his arms. Another tiny kitten. A long-haired brown and black tabby with a crooked tail (though you couldn’t see it under all the fluff)! I was beyond shocked. My husband, the man who tolerated cats, drove to the animal shelter and came home with not one, but two kittens?! He told how our son absolutely loved the kitten and reluctantly left it behind as they exited the kitten room. Scritch scritch scratch. They turned at the noise. And there, at the glass door, was the long-haired tabby kitten, meowing and pawing the glass. The animal shelter staff remarked that the kitten had chosen our son. And that was all it took. My husband and kids were homeward bound, two kittens in tow! It quickly became clear that Buttercup, as I named her, was the more reserved of the two. She enjoyed snuggling on my chest as we spent quiet evenings together, long after the rest of the family went to bed. Munchie, the floof, was more of a social butterfly, if you will. He loved the kids and all their busyness. He would do silly things like bite a balloon string and walk around, balloon floating above, kids following along behind, laughing hysterically. And, boy, did Munchie love food! He often could be found letting himself into the pantry by pawing open the cupboard doors. Ten years have since passed. And while we have added other felines to the household, the dynamic duo is still going strong as an integral part of the family. As I type this, Buttercup is patiently waiting for me to sit in my comfy chair and make my lap available. Munchie just relished his midnight snack (of course) and a few head rubs before going on his merry way. And I am privileged to be their person. -- -- Mama. Friend to animals. Nature lover.

He stares back at me from every mirror as I witness our incredible likeness, growing ever more so as I age. We have the same hollowed eyes and identically prominent, rather regal noses, but the similarities don’t end there. We always had similar food preferences, both having a horror of runny eggs or food swimming in an excess of gravy. I inherited his love for Stilton cheese and curries, and later, good single malt Scotch whisky. We shared a dark and slightly macabre sense of humour, and eventually I surmised that my mother found even these rare moments of connection between my father and me to be a slight threat to her need to be the centre of his attention. Our relationship with our father often has a tremendous influence on our future love relationships — especially with those of the opposite sex. Sadly, I was influenced in an entirely unhelpful way. -- -- 41 Modern Women Stubborn optimist, sharing stories of resilience. Grace is a therapist and former midwife.

67,"At Age 27, I Found Out I Was Adopted","Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Charles Amemiya Follow The Narrative Arc -- 71 Share I walked into my mom’s trailer on a cold day, just before Christmas in 1995. She said, “Sit down. I need to tell you something.” As I nervously sat in an old recliner, she calmly said, “I’m not your mom. I’m your adopted mom. You got another mom out there somewhere.” Well, Merry fucking Christmas. I felt like I was going to have a panic attack. My heart was beating fast as hell. My stomach felt queasy. I was dizzy. I was hit with a torrent of mixed emotions. Shock. Anger. Sadness. And an odd sense of curious excitement. I knew why she told me now — when I was 27 years old. She was dying. Just three months earlier, we learned she had cirrhosis of the liver, a fatal condition caused by a previous hepatitis C infection. Death has a way of making people come full circle.

68,23andMe and Mike and Sam,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Former Hot Mess Follow -- Listen Share On June 6, 2023, a DNA test from 2012 revealed a half-sister and biological father I didn’t know existed. I was adopted at 6 weeks old and “the folks that bought me” (a phrase my parents dislike but it makes me laugh) loved me, and raised me to be a kind human and I will always consider them my parents. Blood or no blood. For better or worse. Nothing will ever change my perception of them in that role. I have always known I was adopted. I think I asked where I came from as a small child and my parents told me “You were adopted from a special place in Tennessee.” Ok. I just assumed it meant hatched like an egg and I was from a farm in Tennessee. I moved on. One day in elementary school it came up and I was informed by the girl sitting next to me that my parents weren’t actually my parents. WTF. We needed to talk and the next 5 hours of school were excruciatingly slow. I demanded to know why I had been lied to. The short version is that I accepted that I had misunderstood the whole thing from the get-go and decided it was easier going back to how things were two weeks ago, before the family assignment was handed out, so that I didn’t freak out about living in a house with “total strangers”. It had been 7 years, we absolutely weren’t strangers. I pictured myself a fortnight earlier and let that anxiety wash away. I chose two weeks because the weekend before I got into a lot of trouble and as long as we’re erasing time, I’d like to skip that weekend also. I don’t remember what it was I did, but the aftermath was so uncomfortable that I blocked it out. It was probably just me being forced to take accountability for my actions. One night in middle school while my parents were out on their weekly date night, I broke into my dad’s filing cabinet to read my adoption report. It was that or slowly downloading two or three photos of naked women via dial-up while they were gone. I opted for an investment into my own personal history rather than the sweet freedom of jerking off while nobody was around. My dad definitely would have let me read it if I asked, it was just more Mission Impossible sneaking in while they were away. What I learned I decided to keep to myself, that way if I DID ever meet someone who claimed to be related to me, I’d have information to corroborate their story. Over the years I shared that information with a select few I felt comfortable enough with to be vulnerable around. And by comfortable I mean I was fairly certain any “discovered family members” wouldn’t be an elaborate hoax put on by asshole friends. I have always considered myself a Roth. I still do. I just never fit in with my family. It's definitely me and not anything any parent, grandparent, sibling, cousin, aunt or uncle has done. It's a bubble I feel that I have come to understand as just ""vibrating on another wavelength"". I see things differently, my brain functions differently, I'm willing to live differently, etc. And that's ok. It's a fact of life I've come to accept. I'd later discover it's an adopted thing. We decided to go to Chicago for my cousin’s bar mitzvah. This meant that we would see everyone in my extended family for the first time in three years. On June 6th, we set out on the three hour drive to Las Vegas to catch our flight. On the drive I processed attending the weekend and visualized it passing by with ease. Go go powers of manifestation. #inspectorgadget We pulled off in St. George to grab some coffee and it took a while. I pulled out my phone and saw I had 2 unread messages sent at 6:30 in the morning. I didn’t recognize the names. Mike B. Samantha B. Who the hell are they? I read Mike’s message first. It seemed like a scam so I decided to ignore it. I put my phone down and focused on bringing positive vibrations with me. I breathed in and slowly exhaled. I enjoyed the stillness that has always existed behind my eyelids. His message did mention Samantha B. Fine. I’ll check. I looked at my phone and picked it up. I opened Samantha’s message and read the first line. “Hey. This is going to sound crazy.” Britt tapped me and I immediately put my phone down to hand the kids their bagels. That sentence reverberated in my head. I had to know what she wrote. Then came the smoothies. “Your lattes will be out in a bit”. Good. I had a few minutes to spare. I opened Samantha’s message again and started from the top so I didn’t miss anything. “Hey. This is gonna sound crazy. I did a 23andMe and it says that you and I are half-siblings. I would really be interested in meeting up or talking sometime to find out more about you. I sent you an invite on 23andMe, but I didn’t want to wait on that in case you don’t get on there anymore. If you wanna chat message me back or call me some time. My number is 615…” A Nashville area code. I was born in the Elvis Memorial Hospital and adopted from an agency in Memphis, Tennessee that has since closed down and all records were destroyed. Could be a coincidence, lots of people live there. I opened 23&Me. Sure enough, I had a match. Samantha B. Fuck. FUUUUUUUUUCK. I was trying to wrap my head around being in one family and then a new one popped up. And then the enormity of the situation starts to settle in. It’s not just two people I have to get to know. They have people they love and care about that I’m going to have to meet. This didn’t go well for my brother when he met his family in Tennessee. The years of thinking of the worst-case scenario of who I may have been if I stayed might now be revealed. I was literally staring down the barrel of the gun that fired the bullet I dodged by being a Roth. That was an overwhelming concept…especially pre-coffee. My general consensus was that I would either be strung out on drugs or dead by 21 had I stayed there. At least that’s what I thought about when I was having trouble falling asleep. And regardless of which family I was raised in, I absolutely would have put money down that I would have been dead by 21. Needless to say, turning 21 meant that I was a failure, just like rehab is for quitters. I decided that I had gone 42 years without knowing anything about myself or anyone who looked like me besides my kids, what’s another week? Get through Chicago and deal with whatever this is going to be like later with a clearer head. Pretty solid plan for a man who’s not fully awake despite a 90-minute drive to St. George. The barista held out two honey lattes. I passed Britt my phone and said, “Here. Read this.” I took a sip and put hers in the cup holder and started to leave the parking lot. “Oh my God, Jeff! Are you going to call her?” “No. Not yet. Let’s just get through Chicago…” ”You HAVE to call her! She’s your sister!!” “Half-sister.” “AND DAD! Don’t you want to know how you got here?” That was a 42-year-old mystery that could now literally be solved with a phone call. The allure was too strong. I DID want to know how I got here. I had already learned that it wasn’t via hatching. “Fine.” I picked up the phone and called her through Facebook Messenger. I was nervous about some random woman from Tennessee reaching out and wanting something from me. I have a successful business and I’m on LinkedIn. You could easily make an assumption that there might be something to get. I was about to drive through the gorge on my way out towards Mesquite, NV so my time for service was limited. In our 3 minute conversation, I learned that she has four children. Two are biologically hers and the other two are her cousins that she took in when their mother died in a car accident. “I got the call that my, our aunt Michelle died and I said ‘I’m taking the kids’ before I even knew what I was saying. Hmmm, rushing into things? That does sound a lot like something I would, uh, do. Maybe we are related? Would I rush into something that in tense? Jesus she sounds like an amazing person. It doesn’t feel like she wants anything from me. I mean, if she’s willing to take in two extra kids? There’s no way the money you’d get from two kids is worth the energy required to raise two humans. That’s insane. She must really love them. Love’s the only thing powerful enough to create a knee-jerk reaction to a lifetime commitment and none of them are pregnant so she’s doing a better job than my biological mom. Ok. Give her a serious chance and be open to whatever comes from this. I was so impressed with her as a human that I knew I needed her in my life in some capacity. I asked her about “Pops”, our shared father. She said he was a talented craftsman, kind, similar to her, and an absolute animal lover. He also played football in high school and that he had a twin sister who died when he was a toddler. My heart was racing. My wife squealed with glee! “Kids you have a new aunt and some cousins you’d don’t know!!” Those were the two pieces of info I had been waiting to hear to validate the legitimacy of the claim. The adoption report said my mother knew who the father was and that she wanted to keep him out of it. I never put any thought about that comment beyond, “Well it’s her baby I guess she can do what she wants.” I assumed he didn’t know and therefore I never had any animosity about it. I was born from immaculate conception,…well, that’s what I’m calling it anyway. I learned my biological mother’s name is Laurie and she is from Memphis. Check. Laurie was friends with a group of kids that Pops hung out with and just so happened to be in town visiting her grandparents. The plan was to all meet up at the local swimming hole and nobody but the two of them showed up. See?! They got to talking about how both of them were virgins and voilá, boots were knocked, her grandfather angrily took her away before they could exchange information and he never heard from her again. Pops stuck around for a month, worried that she might be pregnant, and when he didn’t hear anything he went to join the Navy; and that was that. The question I have been pondering for my entire life has just been answered. I know how I got here. Not from violence but from a brief loving moment between two kids. Two fifteen-year-olds. Britt had so many questions and I told her everything I knew. She asked how I was feeling. It was odd. I just felt like I was floating, like walking through a dream. Once we passed through the gorge Sam and I talked for the rest of the drive. And texted in the airport. Sam was all I could think about on the plane. I was happy to give her a few quiet hours because she was attending her husband’s grandmother’s funeral and this super exciting life-changing news was going down at the same time. Her husband was happy to give her time away to talk with me and for that, T-Business, I thank you. The next day I admitted that I was getting this “I think I love you” vibe and she felt the same way. We decided that using our given names was for suckers and that nicknames needed to be created since they would have been when we were kids and we had clearly missed out on that part. Samantha decided to call me “Heffrey.” She felt that it rolled effortlessly off her tongue. The only thing I could think of as a nickname was “Sammie Sosa”. Because the thought of my half-sister being a Dominican-American professional baseball right fielder responsible for 129 home runs (more homers in two years than Babe Ruth, Barry Bonds, or Hank Aaron) was too funny to not keep around. “Oh you found your sister” “I did. Please let me introduce you to Sammy Sosa.” If we’re getting formal with it, it’s “Sweet little tiny baby Sammie Sosa” as a reference to the scene in Talladega Nights when the family is saying grace at the table and Will Ferrell is praying to baby Jesus. “Dear eight-pound, six-ounce newborn infant baby Jesus”. As time went on we realized we, despite a 7 year gap, are essentially twins. We’ve been talking and texting every day since June 6, 2023. She’s an amazing person and I’m super blessed to have someone like her in my life. Here’s where it gets weird. She’s exactly like me. When I look at her it’s like looking at myself at 15, similar face, no beard. We have the same taste in music (“anything but country”) and movies (comedy and horror), the same quirks, the same neurodivergent minds, find the same super weird things hilarious (like really bizarre niche things, such as whispering for no reason or shouting just for fun), and we decided we needed to meet. She wanted me to get to know Pops because he was excited to hear he finally had a son. I told Sam I wanted to get to know her better first. Honestly, if she was a mess, I could have cut and run and gone back to my life as usual. An island of quirkiness. Pops I legitimately felt like I owed something to since he’s half the reason you’re reading this story. What I learned about Pops is that he’s a solid entrepreneur, a skilled woodworker, neurodivergent, and he doesn’t let anyone tell him what to do. “I’ve gotta be me.” Yeah. We’re related. The “don’t tell me what to do” gene is strong within me and much to my chagrin, my daughter has it also. Teenage years are going to be awesome. Pops was also excited to tell me about my “little brother” Peep, a pig in shades. That’s amazing. This has been one of the best and most bizarre experiences of my life. So a few days after discovering each other, Sam and I decided to meet up in Denver that September. I had been to Denver several times and spent a summer in Boulder, CO as an intern at an animation studio. I knew some cool spots and since Sam hadn’t traveled much, I thought it was easier to have her chill out and be toted around from epic adventure to epic adventure. Plus Band of Horses was playing that weekend. Fast forward to Friday, September 15th, 2023. In our typical fashion, we stress checked-in with our spouses about our packing choices and obviously waited until the last minute to do it. I neglected to send her my flight info so she didn’t know what gate to go to and didn’t meet me at my gate with her sign. So we spent 5 minutes on the phone trying to find each other…again. I knew she liked skulls (fuck yeah, I had some on my wedding cake) and magnets so I bought her a sugar skull magnet at the Vegas airport. Knowing that I wear my shades everywhere I placed the magnet inside my glasses case for safekeeping and so that I didn’t have to search around like an asshole to find her present. I could cooly reach into my glasses case, pull out the magnet, throw on my shades, and say, “Let’s roll.” or “Fucking giddy-up” or something more clever that I would have thought of on the spot under the crushing weight of the biggest introduction to another adult human I’ve ever had in my entire life. Well, guess who ended up searching around their bag like an asshole trying to find her present? Yeah, I was so nervous I forgot about my shades, and the whole “trying to find a stranger via phone call in a crowded airport” pushed me off my game. And believe me, I have “game”. Ask my mom. And then explain to her what I’m trying to say. I’m pretty sure she’ll agree with me. What I noticed first is that we have the same hairstyle. Sam put a lot of effort into the sign she made me. She smells like clean laundry. Ok, we’re off to an excellent start. We made our way out with our carry-on luggage to the Turo Lexus RX300 I had rented. I was excited about syncing my phone to the car for maximum comfort and a hands-free experience, given the egregious blunder that was made in Seattle a few months earlier. The screen seen on the dash in the Seattle car was an add-on for a rear camera, and my Google Maps shouted at me from the cup holder. No, I was not going to mess this up. I got the Lexus, great. Now all I have to do is just get these two to talk and…Hmm well let’s try this, no…Ok perhaps the vin number is needed to… THE FUCKING CUPHOLDER GPS HAD REARED IT’S UGLY HEAD AGAIN! Fuck it, off we go. I backed up about three feet and realized I needed sunglasses. I pulled forward, put it in park, ran around to the back and HEY! I found your Las Vegas magnet! In the one place I didn’t look and the first place I thought I would. Typical me. Our first stop was Rosenberg’s Deli in Denver. She had an egg everything bagel, which is super rare to find outside of New York City and I made her try some Matzah Ball soup. Gotta get the Jewy things done first since it WAS Rosh Ha’Shona. Thank G-d, what a new year! I’ve definitely had better Matzah Ball soup, and I’ll always come back for those bagels. It’s my Denver pilgrimage. We wrapped up breakfast and I headed straight over to the capital building. I learned at the bottom of a page in “Uncle John’s Big Bathroom Reader” that the 13th step of the Colorado capital is exactly one mile above sea level. Given that Sam’s limited travel experience included a few cities in Tennessee and a single visit to Florida one time, I thought it would be a cool thing to do and take a photo of. It was kind of lame, at least I was paranoid that it was and Sam told me she found it interesting. She always knows what to say to make me feel better. So with the potential lameness and awkward photos behind us, we drove to our Airbnb in Boulder. Traffic had really increased since the summer of 2005 and while it took much longer to get to Boulder, I did have an opportunity to enjoy the Rockies in slow motion. Sam didn’t mind the drive either, so we sat there listening to the “Siblings Roadtrip Playlist” we had carefully curated and visually feasted upon the green and grey views outside the window while Rainbow Kitten Surprise jammed out of the speakers. Sam and I had an amazing time in Boulder. I took her to her first dispensary. We bonded over some Bee Stings, a honey-drizzled Hefeweizen that went down too smoothly and half staggered into a thrift shop where we tried on ugly clothes and laughed at each other. We both felt like we were no longer on a lonely island of weirdness that nobody else gets. WE get US! It’s so refreshing. We walked around Pearl Street and hit up my old haunts, went on a hike in the mountains, saw Band of Horses, got matching Honeysuckle tattoos (a smell near and dear to both of our childhoods) and laughed our asses off. Because, obviously we’re both hilarious..and we constantly tell each other how awesome we are...and criminally good-looking. Truthfully its like one big ego circle jerk and we both find it to be so hilarious that we mention it on every phone call. One of my favorite moments of the trip came at the Band of Horses show. We were chilling in the balcony seats and I noticed my leg was gently touching hers. It occurred to me that this was an experience from childhood I missed out with her. Just being kids laying all over each other. Royce and Finn do it all the time. She didn’t seem to mind and I was really touched that she felt that comfortable with me. I reached down to slide my finger between our knees in the spot they were touching to say something and I stopped immediately. It was her chair! We laughed our asses off about that and Sam put her arm around mine and we sat watching the show together. Neither one of us like people in our personal space and yet we both agreed the other person felt like a natural extension of ourselves. That’s some twin stuff right there. I eventually reached out to Pops and began to form a relationship with him. He was initially saddened by so much lost time. I tried to cheer him up. October came around and my family flew to Louisville, Ky to visit my parents for a few days before Sam and her crew drove up. My parents did really well not being weirded out by the whole thing and according to my father, “More family is a blessing.” Kudos to being that chill and I wished they had that attitude when I karate kicked my brother into his dresser and cause him to cut his butt cheek on a nail that was barely sticking out. They lost their shit and perhaps rightfully so. All I know is my little brother had it coming. I spent that Saturday constantly checking my watch, silently panicking about meeting my biological father, watching the minutes tick by. What I failed to consider is that I would very much be like him and that I shouldn’t worry about it. Shit got real weird when he showed up and both of our glasses were the same shape and automatically tinted in the sun. I eerily look like him, which shouldn’t be that eerie except for the fact that I didn’t know anyone that looked like me and now I’m standing next to a carbon copy who happens to be 16 years older than me. We brought Pops and his girlfriend Kim inside for a discussion of who, how, when, where…all the things. Pops felt weird for abandoning me and my parents went on and on about what I pleasure I was growing up. YEEEAAAAAH there’s no way that’s true. As a bipolar empath, my energy was all over the place. You can feel when I’m happy or unhappy and given my first adjective I know part of my time with them I was a fucking nightmare…and they didn’t understand why. What a mind fuck it was to descend into madness with ZERO understanding of what’s happening and seeing other people not feeling the same way. Again I guess it boils down to not having my tribe (yet) and not truly being understood by anyone, no matter how hard they tried. After an hour or so of sitting around and having me be the center of attention, which is normally fine but in this case it felt extra, we decided to go out for dinner. I was not feeling this interaction at all. It was overwhelming with no room to just leave for a few minutes to collect myself. I just had to sit there and deal with it. Stone sober too! Fortunately, my mom kept the conversation rolling. A couple of hours later we headed out to one of my Dad’s favorite restaurants: Tumbleweed Tex-Mex Grill. Car doors slammed and I was stuck riding in the back of Pop’s car. My “stepmom?” Kim drove because the whole experience was too draining for Pops. Now out of the firing squad, we took a moment to breathe and soak up the silence, broken only by the occasional sigh. What I noticed on that 15-minute car ride was a quiet stillness I hadn’t felt before. Sam and I have it however, since she and I are almost the same person, it just seemed to fit in the grand scheme of things between us…like obviously that would make sense. I had only been around Pops for a short time so I found it unusual. I mean, I was happy to experience it because I never got how families could just sit around and be with each other. It never made sense. After this interaction, I popped into our local chiropractor to shoot the shit. (I live in a very small town so this kind of interaction isn’t that unusual.) I told him I met my biological family and we briefly discussed it. When I got to the part about the quiet stillness I experienced he mentioned that he TOO had never felt that stillness and also had no idea what his wife was talking about when she mentioned it. I truly think it’s an adoption thing. You’re taken away from blood and never fully experience a true familial bond. I’ve felt it with a few friends however that’s chosen, and at some point, it just happens. It’s not like I have one foot out the door at family functions but an edible definitely makes family gatherings more enjoyable…especially with a large, intensely loud family at Thanksgiving. So if your adopted kid is a little weird, maybe it’s the lack of genetic connection. I’m not sure what I was afraid of, to be honest. I had a knee-jerk reaction of not wanting to meet him so I did some soul-searching on a few edibles as I watched a rainstorm roll in from miles away, getting closer by the minute. What I discovered was a part of myself I had been hiding from and didn’t want to confront. To meet my Pops I needed to be at peace with myself first, so I could let some love in. The “shadow” side of yourself must be acknowledged and appreciated because it’s a different side of the same coin meaning you can’t have one without the other. Strangely all your shadow wants to do is protect you, it just goes about it in really fucked up ways. Dinner was far less stressful than the initial interaction. Pops, having raised three girls, was beyond stoked to have two new boys in his life, his own and his grandson. He says he likes little kids, animals, and bikers because they’re all “real as fuck and will let you know if they don’t like you. The biker might be a fat slob but at least you know where you stand with him.” I’d be more concerned about his language around my kids, however…uh…they’ve already learned some choice words and phrases from myself. I guess the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. We said our goodbyes, took some photos and Kim and Pops headed home to Peep. What I learned from all of this is that you really do have a tribe. They are out there. It may take you a long time to find them all, however, collecting tribe members one at a time makes for a better journey. -- -- Former hot mess, confidently winging and frequently entertaining.

69,"We Don’t “Rescue” Children We Adopt, We Raise Them","Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in RICHELLE CAREY Follow -- 2 Listen Share The savior parent myth is dangerous. It’s time we retire it. “They are so lucky you adopted them.” “You did such a wonderful thing adopting and rescuing them.” People said those things to me about the two cats I adopted. Well-meaning people have also said those things to me about adopting my son. I loved my cats (Shelley and Lexi!) and treated them like queens for two decades. That said, the cat distribution system isn’t in the same universe as adopting a human. That should go without saying, but apparently, it needs to be said. Adopted children are not rescued. They don’t owe anyone gratitude for adopting them. (Cats don’t either–as any cat parent can tell you, cats don’t do gratitude. They know we are grateful for *them*.) The idea that adopted children are being saved is one of the most pervasive and damaging myths in adoptive parenting. This myth perpetuates the notion that adoptive parents are extraordinary people, akin to saints or heroes, and that adopted children owe them an extraordinary level of gratitude. This is dangerously untrue. Of course, children should be grateful for a loving family, whether biological or adopted. However, adopted children do not owe their parents any more gratitude than children owe their biological parents. This misconception not only places an undue burden on adoptive children but also overshadows the complex realities of adoption. As an adoptive parent, I was required to participate in a seminar about adoption, and what I learned completely upended how I viewed the process. And thank goodness for that. This preparation was crucial for understanding the comments and attitudes I would encounter, such as being told I had done a wonderful thing by adopting. I admit that I once held similar beliefs. How many movies and television shows have framed adoption in this way? Films like “Annie” and “The Blind Side” present adoption as an act of rescue. We now know how far off “The Blind Side” was from the actual story it was based on, yet its influence persists. The savior complex, with its implications of a favor done, can be particularly damaging to children who are already navigating complex emotions. They might feel love for their adoptive parents while simultaneously experiencing loss for their birth families, among many other feelings. This added weight is a burden no child should bear. Adoptive parents with a savior complex need validation, something a child doesn’t owe any adult, regardless of their relationship. Even a well-known children’s author, celebrated for beautifully capturing the essence of family, missed the mark when discussing adoption. Without singling him out, his repeated framing of “you needed and we had” is like a punch in the gut to an adopted child. This wording suggests adoption is a transaction where the child is the needy party, and the parents are benevolent providers, which can be damaging to a child’s self-worth and understanding of family dynamics. Adoption should be understood as the creation of a family, not as an act of charity. It is about forming bonds, providing love and support, and building a future together. Adoptive parents are not heroes; they are parents with all the joys and challenges of the role. Adopted children are not recipients of charity; they are beloved family members. The language we use and the stories we tell about adoption matter. They influence how adopted children see themselves and their place in the world, as well as shape perceptions of how the broader society engages with adoptive parents and children. Moving away from the rescue and heroism narrative can create a more accurate and compassionate understanding. This shift will allow adopted children to grow up without the added burden of feeling like they must be eternally grateful for something that should be their right: a loving, supportive family. So, the next time you meet an adoptive family, remember they are simply a family, like any other. Adoptive parents are not heroes; they are just parents filled with the same love and dedication as any other. Adopted children are not lucky; they are loved. By changing the way we talk about adoption, we can help ensure that all children grow up feeling valued and understood. -- -- 2 Host/Moderator/Keynote Speaker/Journalist, fmr @aljazeeraenglish, @cnn #CareyOn #motherhood #adoption #ivf #eggfreezing #singlemom #introvert #runner Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "
70,,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Kyle Marie Wohlers Follow -- Listen Share “What do you want for your birthday?” my husband asked me as he prepared the kids for their outing. “An orange and white kitten!” I responded, rather frivolously. Not because I had no desire for a kitten. I really did want an orange and white kitten. But, because my husband, the non-animal person in the house, would never take the kids to pick out an animal on his own. Would he? Hours later, the boys returned. I could tell by the smiles on their faces that they were quite pleased with themselves. My husband sent the oldest to grab my surprise. It was the cutest, little orange and white tabby kitten. Short hair, round face, loving eyes. Exactly what I had pictured. The boys excitedly told me about their visit to the animal shelter. How they sat down in the kitten room and this particular kitten snuggled right up. They knew she was the one for me. But that was just the first part of the story. My other son scurried off and returned with something small cradled in his arms. Another tiny kitten. A long-haired brown and black tabby with a crooked tail (though you couldn’t see it under all the fluff)! I was beyond shocked. My husband, the man who tolerated cats, drove to the animal shelter and came home with not one, but two kittens?! He told how our son absolutely loved the kitten and reluctantly left it behind as they exited the kitten room. Scritch scritch scratch. They turned at the noise. And there, at the glass door, was the long-haired tabby kitten, meowing and pawing the glass. The animal shelter staff remarked that the kitten had chosen our son. And that was all it took. My husband and kids were homeward bound, two kittens in tow! It quickly became clear that Buttercup, as I named her, was the more reserved of the two. She enjoyed snuggling on my chest as we spent quiet evenings together, long after the rest of the family went to bed. Munchie, the floof, was more of a social butterfly, if you will. He loved the kids and all their busyness. He would do silly things like bite a balloon string and walk around, balloon floating above, kids following along behind, laughing hysterically. And, boy, did Munchie love food! He often could be found letting himself into the pantry by pawing open the cupboard doors. Ten years have since passed. And while we have added other felines to the household, the dynamic duo is still going strong as an integral part of the family. As I type this, Buttercup is patiently waiting for me to sit in my comfy chair and make my lap available. Munchie just relished his midnight snack (of course) and a few head rubs before going on his merry way. And I am privileged to be their person. -- -- Mama. Friend to animals. Nature lover.

71,My Father and I Have a Better Relationship Since He Died,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Grace Delphia Follow Modern Women -- 41 Share He looks down at me from atop my bookshelf. It’s a lovely photo, taken just a few years before he passed away. He’s standing in a woodland, hands behind his back, smiling. Happy. My father is impossible to avoid. He stares back at me from every mirror as I witness our incredible likeness, growing ever more so as I age. We have the same hollowed eyes and identically prominent, rather regal noses, but the similarities don’t end there. We always had similar food preferences, both having a horror of runny eggs or food swimming in an excess of gravy. I inherited his love for Stilton cheese and curries, and later, good single malt Scotch whisky. We shared a dark and slightly macabre sense of humour, and eventually I surmised that my mother found even these rare moments of connection between my father and me to be a slight threat to her need to be the centre of his attention. Our relationship with our father often has a tremendous influence on our future love relationships — especially with those of the opposite sex.

72,"At Age 27, I Found Out I Was Adopted","Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Charles Amemiya Follow The Narrative Arc -- 71 Share I walked into my mom’s trailer on a cold day, just before Christmas in 1995. She said, “Sit down. I need to tell you something.” As I nervously sat in an old recliner, she calmly said, “I’m not your mom. I’m your adopted mom. You got another mom out there somewhere.” Well, Merry fucking Christmas. I felt like I was going to have a panic attack. My heart was beating fast as hell. My stomach felt queasy. I was dizzy. I was hit with a torrent of mixed emotions. Shock. Anger. Sadness. And an odd sense of curious excitement. I knew why she told me now — when I was 27 years old. She was dying. Just three months earlier, we learned she had cirrhosis of the liver, a fatal condition caused by a previous hepatitis C infection. Death has a way of making people come full circle.

73,23andMe and Mike and Sam,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Former Hot Mess Follow -- Listen Share On June 6, 2023, a DNA test from 2012 revealed a half-sister and biological father I didn’t know existed. I was adopted at 6 weeks old and “the folks that bought me” (a phrase my parents dislike but it makes me laugh) loved me, and raised me to be a kind human and I will always consider them my parents. Blood or no blood. For better or worse. Nothing will ever change my perception of them in that role. I have always known I was adopted. I think I asked where I came from as a small child and my parents told me “You were adopted from a special place in Tennessee.” Ok. I just assumed it meant hatched like an egg and I was from a farm in Tennessee. I moved on. One day in elementary school it came up and I was informed by the girl sitting next to me that my parents weren’t actually my parents. WTF. We needed to talk and the next 5 hours of school were excruciatingly slow. I demanded to know why I had been lied to. The short version is that I accepted that I had misunderstood the whole thing from the get-go and decided it was easier going back to how things were two weeks ago, before the family assignment was handed out, so that I didn’t freak out about living in a house with “total strangers”. It had been 7 years, we absolutely weren’t strangers. I pictured myself a fortnight earlier and let that anxiety wash away. I chose two weeks because the weekend before I got into a lot of trouble and as long as we’re erasing time, I’d like to skip that weekend also. I don’t remember what it was I did, but the aftermath was so uncomfortable that I blocked it out. It was probably just me being forced to take accountability for my actions. One night in middle school while my parents were out on their weekly date night, I broke into my dad’s filing cabinet to read my adoption report. It was that or slowly downloading two or three photos of naked women via dial-up while they were gone. I opted for an investment into my own personal history rather than the sweet freedom of jerking off while nobody was around. My dad definitely would have let me read it if I asked, it was just more Mission Impossible sneaking in while they were away. What I learned I decided to keep to myself, that way if I DID ever meet someone who claimed to be related to me, I’d have information to corroborate their story. Over the years I shared that information with a select few I felt comfortable enough with to be vulnerable around. And by comfortable I mean I was fairly certain any “discovered family members” wouldn’t be an elaborate hoax put on by asshole friends. I have always considered myself a Roth. I still do. I just never fit in with my family. It's definitely me and not anything any parent, grandparent, sibling, cousin, aunt or uncle has done. It's a bubble I feel that I have come to understand as just ""vibrating on another wavelength"". I see things differently, my brain functions differently, I'm willing to live differently, etc. And that's ok. It's a fact of life I've come to accept. I'd later discover it's an adopted thing. We decided to go to Chicago for my cousin’s bar mitzvah. This meant that we would see everyone in my extended family for the first time in three years. On June 6th, we set out on the three hour drive to Las Vegas to catch our flight. On the drive I processed attending the weekend and visualized it passing by with ease. Go go powers of manifestation. #inspectorgadget We pulled off in St. George to grab some coffee and it took a while. I pulled out my phone and saw I had 2 unread messages sent at 6:30 in the morning. I didn’t recognize the names. Mike B. Samantha B. Who the hell are they? I read Mike’s message first. It seemed like a scam so I decided to ignore it. I put my phone down and focused on bringing positive vibrations with me. I breathed in and slowly exhaled. I enjoyed the stillness that has always existed behind my eyelids. His message did mention Samantha B. Fine. I’ll check. I looked at my phone and picked it up. I opened Samantha’s message and read the first line. “Hey. This is going to sound crazy.” Britt tapped me and I immediately put my phone down to hand the kids their bagels. That sentence reverberated in my head. I had to know what she wrote. Then came the smoothies. “Your lattes will be out in a bit”. Good. I had a few minutes to spare. I opened Samantha’s message again and started from the top so I didn’t miss anything. “Hey. This is gonna sound crazy. I did a 23andMe and it says that you and I are half-siblings. I would really be interested in meeting up or talking sometime to find out more about you. I sent you an invite on 23andMe, but I didn’t want to wait on that in case you don’t get on there anymore. If you wanna chat message me back or call me some time. My number is 615…” A Nashville area code. I was born in the Elvis Memorial Hospital and adopted from an agency in Memphis, Tennessee that has since closed down and all records were destroyed. Could be a coincidence, lots of people live there. I opened 23&Me. Sure enough, I had a match. Samantha B. Fuck. FUUUUUUUUUCK. I was trying to wrap my head around being in one family and then a new one popped up. And then the enormity of the situation starts to settle in. It’s not just two people I have to get to know. They have people they love and care about that I’m going to have to meet. This didn’t go well for my brother when he met his family in Tennessee. The years of thinking of the worst-case scenario of who I may have been if I stayed might now be revealed. I was literally staring down the barrel of the gun that fired the bullet I dodged by being a Roth. That was an overwhelming concept…especially pre-coffee. My general consensus was that I would either be strung out on drugs or dead by 21 had I stayed there. At least that’s what I thought about when I was having trouble falling asleep. And regardless of which family I was raised in, I absolutely would have put money down that I would have been dead by 21. Needless to say, turning 21 meant that I was a failure, just like rehab is for quitters. I decided that I had gone 42 years without knowing anything about myself or anyone who looked like me besides my kids, what’s another week? Get through Chicago and deal with whatever this is going to be like later with a clearer head. Pretty solid plan for a man who’s not fully awake despite a 90-minute drive to St. George. The barista held out two honey lattes. I passed Britt my phone and said, “Here. Read this.” I took a sip and put hers in the cup holder and started to leave the parking lot. “Oh my God, Jeff! Are you going to call her?” “No. Not yet. Let’s just get through Chicago…” ”You HAVE to call her! She’s your sister!!” “Half-sister.” “AND DAD! Don’t you want to know how you got here?” That was a 42-year-old mystery that could now literally be solved with a phone call. The allure was too strong. I DID want to know how I got here. I had already learned that it wasn’t via hatching. “Fine.” I picked up the phone and called her through Facebook Messenger. I was nervous about some random woman from Tennessee reaching out and wanting something from me. I have a successful business and I’m on LinkedIn. You could easily make an assumption that there might be something to get. I was about to drive through the gorge on my way out towards Mesquite, NV so my time for service was limited. In our 3 minute conversation, I learned that she has four children. Two are biologically hers and the other two are her cousins that she took in when their mother died in a car accident. “I got the call that my, our aunt Michelle died and I said ‘I’m taking the kids’ before I even knew what I was saying. Hmmm, rushing into things? That does sound a lot like something I would, uh, do. Maybe we are related? Would I rush into something that in tense? Jesus she sounds like an amazing person. It doesn’t feel like she wants anything from me. I mean, if she’s willing to take in two extra kids? There’s no way the money you’d get from two kids is worth the energy required to raise two humans. That’s insane. She must really love them. Love’s the only thing powerful enough to create a knee-jerk reaction to a lifetime commitment and none of them are pregnant so she’s doing a better job than my biological mom. Ok. Give her a serious chance and be open to whatever comes from this. I was so impressed with her as a human that I knew I needed her in my life in some capacity. I asked her about “Pops”, our shared father. She said he was a talented craftsman, kind, similar to her, and an absolute animal lover. He also played football in high school and that he had a twin sister who died when he was a toddler. My heart was racing. My wife squealed with glee! “Kids you have a new aunt and some cousins you’d don’t know!!” Those were the two pieces of info I had been waiting to hear to validate the legitimacy of the claim. The adoption report said my mother knew who the father was and that she wanted to keep him out of it. I never put any thought about that comment beyond, “Well it’s her baby I guess she can do what she wants.” I assumed he didn’t know and therefore I never had any animosity about it. I was born from immaculate conception,…well, that’s what I’m calling it anyway. I learned my biological mother’s name is Laurie and she is from Memphis. Check. Laurie was friends with a group of kids that Pops hung out with and just so happened to be in town visiting her grandparents. The plan was to all meet up at the local swimming hole and nobody but the two of them showed up. See?! They got to talking about how both of them were virgins and voilá, boots were knocked, her grandfather angrily took her away before they could exchange information and he never heard from her again. Pops stuck around for a month, worried that she might be pregnant, and when he didn’t hear anything he went to join the Navy; and that was that. The question I have been pondering for my entire life has just been answered. I know how I got here. Not from violence but from a brief loving moment between two kids. Two fifteen-year-olds. Britt had so many questions and I told her everything I knew. She asked how I was feeling. It was odd. I just felt like I was floating, like walking through a dream. Once we passed through the gorge Sam and I talked for the rest of the drive. And texted in the airport. Sam was all I could think about on the plane. I was happy to give her a few quiet hours because she was attending her husband’s grandmother’s funeral and this super exciting life-changing news was going down at the same time. Her husband was happy to give her time away to talk with me and for that, T-Business, I thank you. The next day I admitted that I was getting this “I think I love you” vibe and she felt the same way. We decided that using our given names was for suckers and that nicknames needed to be created since they would have been when we were kids and we had clearly missed out on that part. Samantha decided to call me “Heffrey.” She felt that it rolled effortlessly off her tongue. The only thing I could think of as a nickname was “Sammie Sosa”. Because the thought of my half-sister being a Dominican-American professional baseball right fielder responsible for 129 home runs (more homers in two years than Babe Ruth, Barry Bonds, or Hank Aaron) was too funny to not keep around. “Oh you found your sister” “I did. Please let me introduce you to Sammy Sosa.” If we’re getting formal with it, it’s “Sweet little tiny baby Sammie Sosa” as a reference to the scene in Talladega Nights when the family is saying grace at the table and Will Ferrell is praying to baby Jesus. “Dear eight-pound, six-ounce newborn infant baby Jesus”. As time went on we realized we, despite a 7 year gap, are essentially twins. We’ve been talking and texting every day since June 6, 2023. She’s an amazing person and I’m super blessed to have someone like her in my life. Here’s where it gets weird. She’s exactly like me. When I look at her it’s like looking at myself at 15, similar face, no beard. We have the same taste in music (“anything but country”) and movies (comedy and horror), the same quirks, the same neurodivergent minds, find the same super weird things hilarious (like really bizarre niche things, such as whispering for no reason or shouting just for fun), and we decided we needed to meet. She wanted me to get to know Pops because he was excited to hear he finally had a son. I told Sam I wanted to get to know her better first. Honestly, if she was a mess, I could have cut and run and gone back to my life as usual. An island of quirkiness. Pops I legitimately felt like I owed something to since he’s half the reason you’re reading this story. What I learned about Pops is that he’s a solid entrepreneur, a skilled woodworker, neurodivergent, and he doesn’t let anyone tell him what to do. “I’ve gotta be me.” Yeah. We’re related. The “don’t tell me what to do” gene is strong within me and much to my chagrin, my daughter has it also. Teenage years are going to be awesome. Pops was also excited to tell me about my “little brother” Peep, a pig in shades. That’s amazing. This has been one of the best and most bizarre experiences of my life. So a few days after discovering each other, Sam and I decided to meet up in Denver that September. I had been to Denver several times and spent a summer in Boulder, CO as an intern at an animation studio. I knew some cool spots and since Sam hadn’t traveled much, I thought it was easier to have her chill out and be toted around from epic adventure to epic adventure. Plus Band of Horses was playing that weekend. Fast forward to Friday, September 15th, 2023. In our typical fashion, we stress checked-in with our spouses about our packing choices and obviously waited until the last minute to do it. I neglected to send her my flight info so she didn’t know what gate to go to and didn’t meet me at my gate with her sign. So we spent 5 minutes on the phone trying to find each other…again. I knew she liked skulls (fuck yeah, I had some on my wedding cake) and magnets so I bought her a sugar skull magnet at the Vegas airport. Knowing that I wear my shades everywhere I placed the magnet inside my glasses case for safekeeping and so that I didn’t have to search around like an asshole to find her present. I could cooly reach into my glasses case, pull out the magnet, throw on my shades, and say, “Let’s roll.” or “Fucking giddy-up” or something more clever that I would have thought of on the spot under the crushing weight of the biggest introduction to another adult human I’ve ever had in my entire life. Well, guess who ended up searching around their bag like an asshole trying to find her present? Yeah, I was so nervous I forgot about my shades, and the whole “trying to find a stranger via phone call in a crowded airport” pushed me off my game. And believe me, I have “game”. Ask my mom. And then explain to her what I’m trying to say. I’m pretty sure she’ll agree with me. What I noticed first is that we have the same hairstyle. Sam put a lot of effort into the sign she made me. She smells like clean laundry. Ok, we’re off to an excellent start. We made our way out with our carry-on luggage to the Turo Lexus RX300 I had rented. I was excited about syncing my phone to the car for maximum comfort and a hands-free experience, given the egregious blunder that was made in Seattle a few months earlier. The screen seen on the dash in the Seattle car was an add-on for a rear camera, and my Google Maps shouted at me from the cup holder. No, I was not going to mess this up. I got the Lexus, great. Now all I have to do is just get these two to talk and…Hmm well let’s try this, no…Ok perhaps the vin number is needed to… THE FUCKING CUPHOLDER GPS HAD REARED IT’S UGLY HEAD AGAIN! Fuck it, off we go. I backed up about three feet and realized I needed sunglasses. I pulled forward, put it in park, ran around to the back and HEY! I found your Las Vegas magnet! In the one place I didn’t look and the first place I thought I would. Typical me. Our first stop was Rosenberg’s Deli in Denver. She had an egg everything bagel, which is super rare to find outside of New York City and I made her try some Matzah Ball soup. Gotta get the Jewy things done first since it WAS Rosh Ha’Shona. Thank G-d, what a new year! I’ve definitely had better Matzah Ball soup, and I’ll always come back for those bagels. It’s my Denver pilgrimage. We wrapped up breakfast and I headed straight over to the capital building. I learned at the bottom of a page in “Uncle John’s Big Bathroom Reader” that the 13th step of the Colorado capital is exactly one mile above sea level. Given that Sam’s limited travel experience included a few cities in Tennessee and a single visit to Florida one time, I thought it would be a cool thing to do and take a photo of. It was kind of lame, at least I was paranoid that it was and Sam told me she found it interesting. She always knows what to say to make me feel better. So with the potential lameness and awkward photos behind us, we drove to our Airbnb in Boulder. Traffic had really increased since the summer of 2005 and while it took much longer to get to Boulder, I did have an opportunity to enjoy the Rockies in slow motion. Sam didn’t mind the drive either, so we sat there listening to the “Siblings Roadtrip Playlist” we had carefully curated and visually feasted upon the green and grey views outside the window while Rainbow Kitten Surprise jammed out of the speakers. Sam and I had an amazing time in Boulder. I took her to her first dispensary. We bonded over some Bee Stings, a honey-drizzled Hefeweizen that went down too smoothly and half staggered into a thrift shop where we tried on ugly clothes and laughed at each other. We both felt like we were no longer on a lonely island of weirdness that nobody else gets. WE get US! It’s so refreshing. We walked around Pearl Street and hit up my old haunts, went on a hike in the mountains, saw Band of Horses, got matching Honeysuckle tattoos (a smell near and dear to both of our childhoods) and laughed our asses off. Because, obviously we’re both hilarious..and we constantly tell each other how awesome we are...and criminally good-looking. Truthfully its like one big ego circle jerk and we both find it to be so hilarious that we mention it on every phone call. One of my favorite moments of the trip came at the Band of Horses show. We were chilling in the balcony seats and I noticed my leg was gently touching hers. It occurred to me that this was an experience from childhood I missed out with her. Just being kids laying all over each other. Royce and Finn do it all the time. She didn’t seem to mind and I was really touched that she felt that comfortable with me. I reached down to slide my finger between our knees in the spot they were touching to say something and I stopped immediately. It was her chair! We laughed our asses off about that and Sam put her arm around mine and we sat watching the show together. Neither one of us like people in our personal space and yet we both agreed the other person felt like a natural extension of ourselves. That’s some twin stuff right there. I eventually reached out to Pops and began to form a relationship with him. He was initially saddened by so much lost time. I tried to cheer him up. October came around and my family flew to Louisville, Ky to visit my parents for a few days before Sam and her crew drove up. My parents did really well not being weirded out by the whole thing and according to my father, “More family is a blessing.” Kudos to being that chill and I wished they had that attitude when I karate kicked my brother into his dresser and cause him to cut his butt cheek on a nail that was barely sticking out. They lost their shit and perhaps rightfully so. All I know is my little brother had it coming. I spent that Saturday constantly checking my watch, silently panicking about meeting my biological father, watching the minutes tick by. What I failed to consider is that I would very much be like him and that I shouldn’t worry about it. Shit got real weird when he showed up and both of our glasses were the same shape and automatically tinted in the sun. I eerily look like him, which shouldn’t be that eerie except for the fact that I didn’t know anyone that looked like me and now I’m standing next to a carbon copy who happens to be 16 years older than me. We brought Pops and his girlfriend Kim inside for a discussion of who, how, when, where…all the things. Pops felt weird for abandoning me and my parents went on and on about what I pleasure I was growing up. YEEEAAAAAH there’s no way that’s true. As a bipolar empath, my energy was all over the place. You can feel when I’m happy or unhappy and given my first adjective I know part of my time with them I was a fucking nightmare…and they didn’t understand why. What a mind fuck it was to descend into madness with ZERO understanding of what’s happening and seeing other people not feeling the same way. Again I guess it boils down to not having my tribe (yet) and not truly being understood by anyone, no matter how hard they tried. After an hour or so of sitting around and having me be the center of attention, which is normally fine but in this case it felt extra, we decided to go out for dinner. I was not feeling this interaction at all. It was overwhelming with no room to just leave for a few minutes to collect myself. I just had to sit there and deal with it. Stone sober too! Fortunately, my mom kept the conversation rolling. A couple of hours later we headed out to one of my Dad’s favorite restaurants: Tumbleweed Tex-Mex Grill. Car doors slammed and I was stuck riding in the back of Pop’s car. My “stepmom?” Kim drove because the whole experience was too draining for Pops. Now out of the firing squad, we took a moment to breathe and soak up the silence, broken only by the occasional sigh. What I noticed on that 15-minute car ride was a quiet stillness I hadn’t felt before. Sam and I have it however, since she and I are almost the same person, it just seemed to fit in the grand scheme of things between us…like obviously that would make sense. I had only been around Pops for a short time so I found it unusual. I mean, I was happy to experience it because I never got how families could just sit around and be with each other. It never made sense. After this interaction, I popped into our local chiropractor to shoot the shit. (I live in a very small town so this kind of interaction isn’t that unusual.) I told him I met my biological family and we briefly discussed it. When I got to the part about the quiet stillness I experienced he mentioned that he TOO had never felt that stillness and also had no idea what his wife was talking about when she mentioned it. I truly think it’s an adoption thing. You’re taken away from blood and never fully experience a true familial bond. I’ve felt it with a few friends however that’s chosen, and at some point, it just happens. It’s not like I have one foot out the door at family functions but an edible definitely makes family gatherings more enjoyable…especially with a large, intensely loud family at Thanksgiving. So if your adopted kid is a little weird, maybe it’s the lack of genetic connection. I’m not sure what I was afraid of, to be honest. I had a knee-jerk reaction of not wanting to meet him so I did some soul-searching on a few edibles as I watched a rainstorm roll in from miles away, getting closer by the minute. What I discovered was a part of myself I had been hiding from and didn’t want to confront. To meet my Pops I needed to be at peace with myself first, so I could let some love in. The “shadow” side of yourself must be acknowledged and appreciated because it’s a different side of the same coin meaning you can’t have one without the other. Strangely all your shadow wants to do is protect you, it just goes about it in really fucked up ways. Dinner was far less stressful than the initial interaction. Pops, having raised three girls, was beyond stoked to have two new boys in his life, his own and his grandson. He says he likes little kids, animals, and bikers because they’re all “real as fuck and will let you know if they don’t like you. The biker might be a fat slob but at least you know where you stand with him.” I’d be more concerned about his language around my kids, however…uh…they’ve already learned some choice words and phrases from myself. I guess the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. We said our goodbyes, took some photos and Kim and Pops headed home to Peep. What I learned from all of this is that you really do have a tribe. They are out there. It may take you a long time to find them all, however, collecting tribe members one at a time makes for a better journey. -- -- Former hot mess, confidently winging and frequently entertaining.

74,"We Don’t “Rescue” Children We Adopt, We Raise Them","Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in RICHELLE CAREY Follow -- 2 Listen Share The savior parent myth is dangerous. It’s time we retire it. “They are so lucky you adopted them.” “You did such a wonderful thing adopting and rescuing them.” People said those things to me about the two cats I adopted. Well-meaning people have also said those things to me about adopting my son. I loved my cats (Shelley and Lexi!) and treated them like queens for two decades. That said, the cat distribution system isn’t in the same universe as adopting a human. That should go without saying, but apparently, it needs to be said. Adopted children are not rescued. They don’t owe anyone gratitude for adopting them. (Cats don’t either–as any cat parent can tell you, cats don’t do gratitude. They know we are grateful for *them*.) The idea that adopted children are being saved is one of the most pervasive and damaging myths in adoptive parenting. This myth perpetuates the notion that adoptive parents are extraordinary people, akin to saints or heroes, and that adopted children owe them an extraordinary level of gratitude. This is dangerously untrue. Of course, children should be grateful for a loving family, whether biological or adopted. However, adopted children do not owe their parents any more gratitude than children owe their biological parents. This misconception not only places an undue burden on adoptive children but also overshadows the complex realities of adoption. As an adoptive parent, I was required to participate in a seminar about adoption, and what I learned completely upended how I viewed the process. And thank goodness for that. This preparation was crucial for understanding the comments and attitudes I would encounter, such as being told I had done a wonderful thing by adopting. I admit that I once held similar beliefs. How many movies and television shows have framed adoption in this way? Films like “Annie” and “The Blind Side” present adoption as an act of rescue. We now know how far off “The Blind Side” was from the actual story it was based on, yet its influence persists. The savior complex, with its implications of a favor done, can be particularly damaging to children who are already navigating complex emotions. They might feel love for their adoptive parents while simultaneously experiencing loss for their birth families, among many other feelings. This added weight is a burden no child should bear. Adoptive parents with a savior complex need validation, something a child doesn’t owe any adult, regardless of their relationship. Even a well-known children’s author, celebrated for beautifully capturing the essence of family, missed the mark when discussing adoption. Without singling him out, his repeated framing of “you needed and we had” is like a punch in the gut to an adopted child. This wording suggests adoption is a transaction where the child is the needy party, and the parents are benevolent providers, which can be damaging to a child’s self-worth and understanding of family dynamics. Adoption should be understood as the creation of a family, not as an act of charity. It is about forming bonds, providing love and support, and building a future together. Adoptive parents are not heroes; they are parents with all the joys and challenges of the role. Adopted children are not recipients of charity; they are beloved family members. The language we use and the stories we tell about adoption matter. They influence how adopted children see themselves and their place in the world, as well as shape perceptions of how the broader society engages with adoptive parents and children. Moving away from the rescue and heroism narrative can create a more accurate and compassionate understanding. This shift will allow adopted children to grow up without the added burden of feeling like they must be eternally grateful for something that should be their right: a loving, supportive family. So, the next time you meet an adoptive family, remember they are simply a family, like any other. Adoptive parents are not heroes; they are just parents filled with the same love and dedication as any other. Adopted children are not lucky; they are loved. By changing the way we talk about adoption, we can help ensure that all children grow up feeling valued and understood. -- -- 2 Host/Moderator/Keynote Speaker/Journalist, fmr @aljazeeraenglish, @cnn #CareyOn #motherhood #adoption #ivf #eggfreezing #singlemom #introvert #runner Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "

76,,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jeanie King Follow -- Listen Share When God wants something to happen.. When we became foster parents we were living on one part time income! Hubby had lost his 12 yr job after injuring his neck and shoulder. We had to live on his lump sum retirement and sell our dream home/ hobby farm before the money ran out. That same year we had said yes to twin toddlers. We were half way through the adoption process when their birth parents changed their minds and took them back. It took almost two years of grieving in the healing house God miraculously got us into, debt free. During that time my husband was hired part time to drive the city bus and I we realized we had essentially fostered the twins. We went through the process to become foster parents and were licensed 3 months after selling our “healing house” for almost double, and purchasing our current home with cash. When God wants something to happen He MORE THAN provides! We took placement of, and fell in love with our first foster child, the sweetest 18 month old little girl, 3 weeks after receiving our license, and adopted her 18 months later. We thought that having a little sibling might help her to develop in multiple positive ways but were not 100% sure of God’s plan since I was 48 and hubby was 56. Then I started having prophetic dreams, scriptures popping out at me, prayers of a complete stranger.. in December 2018, we were miraculously given a car, $1000 cash, and on our 25th anniversary that month my husband was finally promoted to full time hours! Just a few weeks later we received placement of our foster son, the chunkiest, most precious & slobbery 8.5 month old boy who bonded with all of us quickly. We finalized our adoption of him only 1 year later, in February 2020 and closed our license, just as Covid started shutting everything down. I was about to turn 50 and we agreed that two little ones was enough for me to handle alone full time while hubby worked. Then I started having dreams again! We couldn’t understand why God would tell us to adopt when it seemed like we were already at our max. Our oldest son had come home from the AF, diagnosed with MS and was in college but our other adult son and daughter still lived with us. All three bedrooms and the basement apartment were full! Then on December 23, 2020 I received a private message from the birth mother of our twins, “I’m so sorry I ripped them away from you. I wish I had never done that. Would you take them back for good?” I was heartbroken that these girls were not wanted. I didn’t know if I could handle two more! But the dreams came back to me. I suddenly understood their meaning! Our little 5 yo daughter saw my tears and said, “Mama, we can share! I can share my room. They can sleep in the bunk bed!” I realized I had just cleaned out two dresser drawers in her bedroom, emptied a large space in the walk-in closet, and had absent-mindedly wondered what would fill them! My husband and I prayed and pondered separately as he was at work. On Christmas Eve he came home and said, with a mix of resolve and worry, “the only reason we are even thinking about this is because we still love them.” I followed him to the bedroom, as he continued speaking; “it’s the RIGHT thing to do…” He turned around just before opening the door and said, with a giant smile, “YES!” So, we said yes Christmas Eve. Our twins arrived on January 9, 2021 and we finalized their adoption 6 months later! The girls were 7 when they arrived. they were 7 years old. We hadn’t seen them for 7 years. We were in our 27th year of marriage. Their birth parents signed off on June 7th and we finalized in the 7th month of the year, bringing our number of children total to 7!! 7=perfection, completeness.. When God wants something to happen, He does it in a profound way and He provides everything we need at just the right time. Exactly three years from the date we took placement of our first foster child, we finalized our third adoption (twins this time-double blessings). July 26, 2021. I can scarcely believe it’s been almost 3 years! The number 3= harmony, new life/renewal, intervention & completeness. A time of testing or struggle culminating to new birth, strength and readiness! I asked God for a way to work from home but I wanted something that would not just bring in money but help others to earn too. Is it coincidence that the Lord has just provided 3 new sources of income? One to help others earn as they grow in Christ-centered personal & professional Leadership development, the 2nd to earn 100% profit from an automated system, the 3rd to earn affiliate income with an automated system that generates leads. Praise the Lord for His abundant, miraculous provision and opportunity to share it with you! If you’ve read this far I pray our story gives you hope in your own life!

88,Building Stronger Families for a Better Future:,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Cristobal Figueroa Adaros Follow -- Listen Share It is my first post here, and there are two reasons why I’m doing it: Wars, political issues, global warming, a collapsing economy, the rise of mental health struggles, financial struggles, the rise of AI, plus the constant uncertainty of another global event like COVID-19 — all of these factors are creating a turbulent world. On a personal level, we face daily struggles, dealing with a lot of uncertainty due to things we can’t control. The economy is driven by competition, and important decisions are often made through ego, competition and selfishness. Our generation and older generations are leaving a planet in deplorable conditions for future generations. Beyond environmental issues, society is struggling with understanding each other. Children are the future of every society, but now they are struggling to do things that were once normal, like playing in the park and making friends. They are grappling with anxiety, ADHD, depression, and more. This is due to several factors: Excessive use of Screens: An open letter to parents: We need to get our kids off the screens The negative consequences of technology are many. A recent study found that excessive use of screen time during brain development years increases the risk of Alzheimer’s and dementia in adulthood. These researchers predict that by the end of this century, Alzheimer’s and dementia-related illnesses are expected to grow 4 to 6 times more than what they are now. This is a concerning problem right now, but the main consequences will be seen in the future. When this generation of children, currently dealing with all these issues, becomes the driving force of society, they will lack the necessary skills to lead and sustain a thriving community. When they become the force of society, we will be the older ones relying on them for support. After a lifetime of hard work, the least we deserve is a peaceful retirement, wouldn’t you agree? Who is responsible for changing this situation? A common behavior in our society is to avoid responsibility and blame others, leading to many problems remaining unsolved. Should governments, schools, parents, or teachers step up? Education must adapt to the new trends. Kids access information differently now, and we must prepare them for jobs that don’t exist yet. The purpose of education is not just to impart knowledge but to equip future generations with resilience and adaptability to thrive in an evolving landscape. Family should mean love, feeling safe, and having someone you can trust. It instils values, moral responsibilities, and life codes. This transfer of information comes from time immemorial when our ancestors told stories in caves. Unfortunately, we are losing these moments because we no longer have time, it’s easier to look at a screen than into someone’s eyes, and Netflix stories are more entertaining than our ancestors’ tales. To improve the world, we must develop resilience and emotional recognition in children, which often comes from home. By strengthening family bonds and creating experiences where families learn these skills together, we can create a better future. Family Squad (www.familysquad.com.au) is a thoughtfully crafted board game that works as a tool for parents to connect with their kids, strengthen family bonds, and enhance the learning of vital core soft skills through the power of play. The experience was purposely designed as an emotional journey, creating a safe environment where players work as a team, solve problems, and get to know each other on deeper levels while laughing and having fun. Video of Family squad interactions. When I started designing Family Squad, my goal was to create a system that brings kids closer to their parents helping families create meaningful, lasting memories. These moments, full of love, are the ones we cherish as adults because they remind us of our roots and provide the emotional strength to navigate life’s challenges. As we grow older, we forget the importance of play. Playing helps parents forget the stress of daily life by having fun with their families. My aim is that after playing Family Squad, you return to your routine with a smile and a warm heart, cherishing the beautiful moments spent with your family. “Play is the highest form of research.” — Albert Einstein How did I come up with this idea? My biggest superhero is my grandfather, who passed away two years ago. He made me the man I am becoming. When he was 20 years old, he got a scholarship to go to Israel to build social housing for the “kibbutz.” He saw that when people had a physical place to live that they worked for, they spent more time at home, the family grew stronger, and society developed. This was his “Eureka Moment” or the moment he found his purpose. He saw this and went back to Chile, our country, and created hundreds of “Cooperatives” where people worked together to build houses for the community. Beyond providing houses, he gave families hope. I grew up seeing him help everyone he could. He always said, “You must put your vocation at the service of others.” I am trying to follow his example. We are facing a falling society, and children are the future. To create a better society, we must provide the next generation with empathy and resilience. I believe we can change the world. My vision is to shape a more resilient, empathetic, and caring generation of children. My aim with Family Squad and the whole universe of experiences that I want to develop is to have a positive ripple effect on society by positively affecting kids, families, communities, and society as a whole. I understand these changes will take time, and I might not be alive to see them, but I’m at peace with that. “The most powerful person in the world is the storyteller. The storyteller sets the vision, values and agenda of an entire generation that is to come.” Steve Jobs We must adapt to new trends. Learning should be interactive and fun. Technology should be a tool for learning, and parents should have more support on the challenging journey of parenting. Following my grandfather’s teachings, cooperation is the way forward. By working together and helping each other, we can positively impact future generations. We all have a role to play and now is the time to take action. To understand our purpose in life, we must look at where we come from, nature. In nature, there are elements with great purpose like trees. But trees, to fulfil their purpose, need other elements like water, soil, and birds. There are other elements like salt, which as a single element has no purpose. But when salt gets in contact with other elements, it finds its purpose. My reflection is that we might not all be trees, but we are all salts. Creating Family Squad has been an incredible but challenging journey. I’ve reached a point where I need your support to take the next big step. Right now, the cost to manufacture one Family Squad game in Australia is $65 AUD, making it challenging to produce on a larger scale. To make Family Squad affordable and accessible to more families, I’m launching a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. Our goal is to lower the manufacturing cost and sell Family Squad globally, but I can’t do it alone. We need 300 amazing people to pre-order Family Squad at $50 USD each to reach our target. Together, we can change the world, one game at a time. Your support means the world to me and to the future of Family Squad. Together, we can create a brighter, more connected future for families everywhere. Thank you for being part of this journey.

He has outlived my mother, and these past 13 years since her death have given us a chance to connect in ways I never imagined. From my birth, my dad and I enjoyed hanging out together. There are snapshots of me lying on his chest, both of us sound asleep. He recounts how he’d palm my head and my body would rest on his forearm while I’d sleep. As I grew older, he and I would take walks together, me barely able to reach his index finger. When my mother was expecting my brother, my dad and I would go to the park to walk, and then he’d buy me a hotdog, minus the bun, to give her time to herself. He taught us how to ride our bikes, and then, when he was home on the weekends, we’d take long bike rides, just the three of us. It was his way of spending time with us after traveling all week.

102,AI-driven Longevity,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Smart Elder Tech Follow -- 1 Listen Share With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), a new frontier in AI-driven longevity is emerging, offering you the potential to unlock the secrets of aging and extend your lifespan. This informative blog post explores how AI is revolutionizing the field of aging research, offering personalized solutions and cutting-edge technologies to help you live a longer and healthier life. Dive into the world of AI-driven longevity and discover the possibilities that could redefine how you age. One of the earliest recorded instances of aging research can be traced back to ancient Greek times, where philosophers and scholars pondered the nature of aging and its effects on the human body. With the advent of artificial intelligence, the healthcare field has seen a dramatic transformation. AI-powered technologies are revolutionizing medical diagnostics, personalized treatment plans, and drug discovery processes. A new era of precision medicine is dawning, where AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of patient data to identify early signs of disease and tailor interventions to individual needs. This personalized approach to healthcare has the potential to significantly enhance the quality of care and improve health outcomes for people of all ages. The shortening of telomeres, the protective caps at the end of chromosomes, is a key factor in cellular senescence—the process where cells stop dividing and enter a state of growth arrest. As you age, telomeres naturally shorten with each cell division, eventually leading to cellular aging and dysfunction. Aging is also influenced by epigenetic changes that impact gene expression. For instance, DNA methylation patterns can shift with age, affecting which genes are turned on or off. This alteration in gene expression can contribute to various age-related diseases and a decline in cellular function. Learning about aging and its impact on health is crucial for longevity research. Machine learning plays a key role in identifying biomarkers that can indicate the aging process in individuals. By analyzing vast amounts of data, AI algorithms can pinpoint subtle changes at the molecular level that reveal how our bodies age over time. Biomarker discovery relies heavily on a literature review to stay updated with the latest findings. Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms can quickly scan through thousands of scientific papers to extract valuable insights on aging-related biomarkers. This efficient method saves time and ensures that you have access to the most relevant and current information in the field. Natural language processing for literature review involves parsing vast amounts of text to extract key information regarding aging-associated biomarkers. By utilizing advanced NLP algorithms, researchers can quickly sift through an extensive body of scientific literature to identify trends, connections, and potential new avenues for exploration in aging research. Predictive modeling of aging involves leveraging various omics data, such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, to understand the aging process at a molecular level. By integrating these multi-omics data sets, you can receive a personalized prognosis on how your body is aging and identify potential interventions to slow down the process. -- -- 1 Passionate founder of SmartElderTech.com & SmartSeniorsTech.com, using Next-Gen Tech to nurture seniors' well-being.

(He was barely hitting 50 mph.) I know for a good solid fact that my mother has never been a zookeeper. But she’s living in an alternate reality these days — one in which she absolutely 100% remembers taking care of zoo animals. Last week, she also told me I was not her daughter. She didn’t disown me in so many words like, “You are not my daughter.” But when your mother asks you: “Now, when did we meet?” or “Weren’t we roommates across the ocean?” it kinda hits the same way.

When did I stop greeting you on a day so special for fathers like you? For me, and for others like me, whose fathers are physically present but emotionally and mentally absent, this day is a painful reminder. It’s a day that highlights the empty space where warmth and connection should be. I stopped celebrating because there’s nothing to celebrate. You were there, we lived in the same house, but you were never truly there for me. Your presence was a shadow, never a light. You didn't guide, support, or cherish me — you left me feeling like a burden, not a blessing. The bond I yearned for was never formed. Never in my life did I feel you as my father. Never in my life did I feel like I was a daughter. Instead of feeling like your daughter, I grew up feeling like a disappointed woman. I watched other daughters shine in the glow of their fathers' love. They had laughter, guidance, and a sense of security. They had fatherly love. I had silence, indifference, and disappointment. Each Father’s Day, and each day, I waited for a change, for a sign that you cared, but it never came. Eventually, I stopped waiting. When did I start not celebrating this day? It was gradual, a slow crumbling of hope. Every unacknowledged effort, every unmet expectation, took away the idea that you would ever be the father I needed. The day became just another reminder of what was missing, what would never be. When did I stop greeting you on this special day for fathers? It was when I realized that the words felt hollow, that the sentiment was nearly forced. Wishing you a happy Father’s Day felt like a lie, a painful charade. So, I let it go, just as I let go of the hope that you would ever be the father I deserved. In another universe, maybe things are different. Maybe in that universe, I am always a daddy’s girl, cherished and loved. But in this reality, I am left with the disappointment of what could have been. And if I were given the chance to choose my father in this lifetime, I would never choose you again. I have learned to find strength within myself, to seek out the love and support that was missing from you. This is for those who understand this pain, who have walked this lonely path. You are not alone. Your feelings are valid, and your strength in facing this absence is one for the books. Here’s to acknowledging the pain, and to hoping that, in some way, we can heal and find the fatherly love we deserve, even if not from the men who should have given it to us. He did not make me feel like a daughter, but a disappointed woman. Yet, I continue to move forward, carrying the weight of this disappointment.

He is getting stronger at a health and rehabilitation center in New York after falling seriously ill. I had the good fortune to be with him, my mother, and my brothers for two weeks, and I cannot overstate how much it meant to be with them — to spend that time together — just the five of us. You don’t walk around with the same confidence when your father lay in a hospital bed ashen, weakened, and unable to speak above a whisper. You become nervous, unsure, and afraid. I’ve changed because of it, evolved or regressing. I’m as scared as I was as a child. But during that time of vulnerability, my mother and my brothers were with me, and I felt a love that had been sort of shelved somewhere between Ronkonkoma, North Carolina, Massachusetts, and Chicago for the better part of 30 years. My trip home awakened me to the deep love I have for my parents and brothers, and it’s due in large part to my father. The day I had to bid a temporary goodbye to my father in the hospital, I stood next to his bed while my mother took a phone call in the waiting room. I reached over, held his hand, and felt a surge of tears welling behind my eyes. At that moment my father mumbled something to me but I couldn’t make it out, so I squeezed his hand tighter and bent to receive his whisper in my ear. I was like “What, Dad? What is it you want to say to me at this tenderest of moments?” “Your hand is cold,” he said. My father has a long road of recovery ahead of him, and I am counting the days until I can see him again at the end of this month — my wife and sons with me this time. I can’t wait until I can be the man of the house again. I will make sure the pool is properly chlorinated, the garbage is taken out, the dog is taken care of, the shit shoveled off the backyard lawn.

There wasn’t much to remember about him in my early years; he was constantly deployed in countries I don’t recall the names of now. He was so far removed from my memories of my first four or five years of life that my mother recalls my first sentence being, “Where is daddy?” Of course, there is much to say, words of others and not of mine, about the duty, honor, courage — and whatever other rhetorically nationalist adjectives you could throw in there — of a parent who spends their child’s young life ensuring our freedoms overseas. Freedoms upheld or oil tycoons appeased– regardless of the semantics of it, it doesn’t change the collateral damage a camouflage uniform and a family creates. My father wasn’t the only one on the move; the second there was something new somewhere else, and we’d trim off the budding roots from under our feet. We’d pick up what was left of our broken branches, dust off the soil, and pack them neatly in a box.

111,"he did not make me feel like a daughter, but a disappointed woman","Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in iris ୨୧ Follow -- 9 Listen Share maybe in another universe, i will always be a daddy’s girl When did I stop celebrating this day? When did I stop greeting you on a day so special for fathers like you? For me, and for others like me, whose fathers are physically present but emotionally and mentally absent, this day is a painful reminder. It’s a day that highlights the empty space where warmth and connection should be. I stopped celebrating because there’s nothing to celebrate. You were there, we lived in the same house, but you were never truly there for me. Your presence was a shadow, never a light. You didn't guide, support, or cherish me — you left me feeling like a burden, not a blessing. The bond I yearned for was never formed. Never in my life did I feel you as my father. Never in my life did I feel like I was a daughter. Instead of feeling like your daughter, I grew up feeling like a disappointed woman. I watched other daughters shine in the glow of their fathers' love. They had laughter, guidance, and a sense of security. They had fatherly love. I had silence, indifference, and disappointment. Each Father’s Day, and each day, I waited for a change, for a sign that you cared, but it never came. Eventually, I stopped waiting. When did I start not celebrating this day? It was gradual, a slow crumbling of hope. Every unacknowledged effort, every unmet expectation, took away the idea that you would ever be the father I needed. The day became just another reminder of what was missing, what would never be. When did I stop greeting you on this special day for fathers? It was when I realized that the words felt hollow, that the sentiment was nearly forced. Wishing you a happy Father’s Day felt like a lie, a painful charade. So, I let it go, just as I let go of the hope that you would ever be the father I deserved. In another universe, maybe things are different. Maybe in that universe, I am always a daddy’s girl, cherished and loved. But in this reality, I am left with the disappointment of what could have been. And if I were given the chance to choose my father in this lifetime, I would never choose you again. I have learned to find strength within myself, to seek out the love and support that was missing from you. This is for those who understand this pain, who have walked this lonely path. You are not alone. Your feelings are valid, and your strength in facing this absence is one for the books. Here’s to acknowledging the pain, and to hoping that, in some way, we can heal and find the fatherly love we deserve, even if not from the men who should have given it to us. He did not make me feel like a daughter, but a disappointed woman. Yet, I continue to move forward, carrying the weight of this disappointment. Maybe in another universe, I will always be a daddy’s girl. But here, I am learning to be whole on my own. -- -- 9 ‧₊˚🖇️✩ reviving her long lost passion | ᝰ.ᐟ to write and heal ; a safe space ꩜ .ᐟ | ₊˚⊹♡ — @luv4risz on tiktok !

112,"Meditations, Part Two","Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Frank Tempone Follow -- Listen Share Where I expand on my father. Yesterday was my father’s birthday. He is getting stronger at a health and rehabilitation center in New York after falling seriously ill. I had the good fortune to be with him, my mother, and my brothers for two weeks, and I cannot overstate how much it meant to be with them — to spend that time together — just the five of us. You don’t walk around with the same confidence when your father lay in a hospital bed ashen, weakened, and unable to speak above a whisper. You become nervous, unsure, and afraid. I’ve changed because of it, evolved or regressing. I’m as scared as I was as a child. But during that time of vulnerability, my mother and my brothers were with me, and I felt a love that had been sort of shelved somewhere between Ronkonkoma, North Carolina, Massachusetts, and Chicago for the better part of 30 years. My trip home awakened me to the deep love I have for my parents and brothers, and it’s due in large part to my father. The day I had to bid a temporary goodbye to my father in the hospital, I stood next to his bed while my mother took a phone call in the waiting room. I reached over, held his hand, and felt a surge of tears welling behind my eyes. At that moment my father mumbled something to me but I couldn’t make it out, so I squeezed his hand tighter and bent to receive his whisper in my ear. I was like “What, Dad? What is it you want to say to me at this tenderest of moments?” “Your hand is cold,” he said. My father has a long road of recovery ahead of him, and I am counting the days until I can see him again at the end of this month — my wife and sons with me this time. I can’t wait until I can be the man of the house again. I will make sure the pool is properly chlorinated, the garbage is taken out, the dog is taken care of, the shit shoveled off the backyard lawn. I will make sure the back room, a guest bedroom now but my parents’ original bedroom, is ready for when he comes home. -- -- Dad, husband, teacher, and essayist.

113,The Day Dad Rock Died,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Sam Hauff Follow The Riff -- 5 Share I was raised on military bases throughout my childhood, and the ground under my feet was too loose to bury roots. The memories of my father, an Air Force officer, are sporadically placed within the tapestry that is my childhood memories. There wasn’t much to remember about him in my early years; he was constantly deployed in countries I don’t recall the names of now. He was so far removed from my memories of my first four or five years of life that my mother recalls my first sentence being, “Where is daddy?” Of course, there is much to say, words of others and not of mine, about the duty, honor, courage — and whatever other rhetorically nationalist adjectives you could throw in there — of a parent who spends their child’s young life ensuring our freedoms overseas. Freedoms upheld or oil tycoons appeased– regardless of the semantics of it, it doesn’t change the collateral damage a camouflage uniform and a family creates. My father wasn’t the only one on the move; the second there was something new somewhere else, and we’d trim off the budding roots from under our feet. We’d pick up what was left of our broken branches, dust off the soil, and pack them neatly in a box.

For example, studies have found that children that from single-mother households are 5 times more likely to commit suicide than children from both unbroken households and single-father households, 9 times more likely to drop out of high school, 10 times more likely to abuse chemical substances, 14 times more likely to commit rape, 20 times more likely to end up in prison and 32 times more likely to run away from home. The list does not stop there, single-mother households also account for 70% of all teen pregnancies, 70% of all child murders, and they account for the majority of filicide cases, which means yes, a child living in a single-mother household is the most likely to be murdered by their parent. -- -- 146 The Knowledge of Freedom Former sex worker, former sex clinic worker.

It’s not perfectly set and there is some semantic wiggle room, but just because some guy is an asshole in a gym TikTok doesn’t necessarily mean he’s a narcissist. He might be, but we don’t know just from that. There is a trope out there that new parents are raising a bunch of narcissists, which seems to be underscored by (a) current elementary school teachers and (b) Sephora employees. I am not sure if this is true, and even if it’s true in certain families, it’s not true in others. Nothing is universal when you’re talking about millions (billions?) of kids around the world.

And then they both laughed uneasily… but at that moment, my heart broke for these boys, for both of their fathers had walked out on their respective families, and neither had had much contact with him since. Both of these boys were hurting, and they were hiding it, just barely, behind a thin veneer of coarse joking. All of us have had a father. Some of us have had good experiences with our fathers, some of us bad, none of us perfect. As someone who has worked with young people — with people in general — I am all too aware of the powerful impact that a Father has on their children, either for good or evil, no matter what age they are, the consequences of which echo down throughout a person’s life. A father bestows either blessings or curses on his children through his words and actions or his lack thereof.

Yet, it made me realize my mother’s love. My mother was strict, the one I’d get into the most fights with, the one who’d made me cry, and experience anger many times. We’d argue about the clothes I was wearing, what time I got home, and how I acted on occasions. As I got older, things changed, including how I see things.

I started to learn things about the family, harsh things that I didn’t, and would never want to know about. I was slapped by the harsh truth. I wish I was stupid, not knowing the reality of what my father had done to my mother.

I began to spend better time with her, whether it was doing chores together while we talked about numerous things or something as simple as accompanying her grocery shopping. The more I learned, the more I realized about her sacrifices for us. For me. From leaving her ambitions aside to take care of the family to making sure there was always food on the table. It made me remember her promise — a promise she wrote down in her notebook, which I saw secara tidak sengaja. Also, my curiosity took the best of me. But it was a promise I’ll never forget, she wrote: “I promise I will always care and love my husband, daughter, and son. Forever.” She kept that promise. She was always forgiving, even when there was nothing to forgive. She was always patient, even when she shouldn’t be. She deserves the world, and I couldn’t have agreed more.

We grew up without a father figure, and she endured difficult times working for us alone. She took on the responsibility not just as a mother but also as a father to us. She never let us starve; she always found ways to fill our empty stomachs. I have a mom. I still remember our enjoyable moments together—how she would hug me to help me fall asleep, and how she would tell stories of missing me so much the first time she had to work and couldn't see me the whole day. I miss how her eyes would glisten as she told those stories. I miss our deep talks, how she introduced me to the life I would navigate, and how she taught me to be contented with everything I have. I miss her. I have a mom. I used to confide in her about everything. She knew about my crushes since I was in primary school. She witnessed me falling in love for the first time, and she was there when I experienced my first heartbreak. She supported me in everything that made me happy. I grew up being so open with her; I didn't keep any secrets from her. For seven-year-old me, she was my best friend. However... I don’t have a mom, too, because things happened and suddenly we couldn’t feel her presence anymore. Events occurred, and I couldn’t feel her during every special occasion. She wasn’t there on my birthday, graduation, or recognition day. The person who once knew everything about me now seems like a stranger who doesn’t know my favorite food or song. We grew very distant. I don't have a mom. She never knew when I was sick or not feeling well, or when I was about to give up because of how hard it was to feel alone. She never knew how much I needed her; she forgot her responsibilities to us. She chose another man over us. We even heard these words literally coming from her: “Why would I choose you? You’re only my child, and that’s my husband!” See? I have a mom, but it feels like I don’t. I begged her many times to choose me, to choose us. I told her to choose us before we vanished from her life forever. I told her to come back to us before we could finally stand on our own without her. I told her that while we still needed her, she must do anything to give us what we needed. What did we need? Her. We needed her; we needed a mom. I don’t know where everything went wrong. I can still remember how happy we were celebrating with simple things. I felt complete and never felt like something was missing because we had her, even without a father. But Mom, how could you? How could you become a person I still yearn for, even though you hurt this little heart that is completely from yours? How could you leave us hanging, needing our mom while you’re with your husband? How could you sleep at night knowing that you ate something together with him but never thought about what we were eating, or if we were still alive? How could months pass without you even remembering us? How could you be so cruel to us? How could you, Ma? What did we do to deserve this life from you? What wasn't enough for you to leave and let us live on our own? I have so much grudge and resentment towards my mother. The pain of being the eldest child will forever left a void within me. I have a mom who showed me strength and bravery, who filled my childhood with love and taught me invaluable lessons. Yet, I also don’t have a mom because she chose to leave, to prioritize another life over ours. Despite the pain and the unanswered questions, I carry on with a resolve to be different. I will carry the lessons of her presence and absence with me, promising to never let my own children feel the emptiness I have felt. I promise not to be like her someday.

128,My Daughter Calls Herself The “D” Word,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Brenna Clark Follow -- Share Let me tell you about my teenage daughter… She is a beautiful girl, with dark blonde hair and bright blue eyes. Her flawless skin could rival even Snow White’s. While she struggles occasionally in school, you wouldn’t know it from talking to her. After all, she has a great vocabulary, and picks up on little random observations faster than most adults I know. She is a good person — full of empathy. Kind to animals and humans alike. She can connect with others very quickly — especially those who sit outside the “norms” of society. No one is off limits to her. She is a brilliant, creative artist. So talented. I try to tell her these things — these ares of life that she excels at. That they will bring her success, make a difference in her life…and also in the lives of others. That matters. And yet, she doesn’t see this in herself. Not any of it. Instead, she can only focus on two things: her uncontrollable ADHD, and her learning disability diagnosis. Despite her school average being well over 70 percent this year, she still feels like a failure. -- -- Wife, Mom, and fellow human who has no idea what she's doing. Big fan of the Oxford Comma.

129,“Enjoy it now; it only gets harder from here”,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Mumie Health Follow The Parenting Portal -- 16 Share I, like many mums, did not enjoy the period where my son was a tiny baby. Of course, from the outside, or even the deep banks of our own memories, holding a tiny baby who can’t yet answer back, can’t yet scamper away from you or throw food on the floor, is utterly blissful. Motherhood is painted as a beautiful, colourful, chaotic canvas. But for mothers suffering with postnatal depression, this couldn’t be further from the truth. I speak from experience, both from my work as a GP looking after new mothers, but also as a mother. Colours faded, even the chaos is muted. There are no highs, just flat, flat lows, with peaks of anxiety interspersed in between. Every day is a struggle. How will we get out today? Where can we go that doesn’t feel completely overwhelming? No wonder it’s easier for mothers who are struggling to isolate themselves away. So imagine you, trudging through each day, weary from caring for your much longed for child, yet not feeling the surge of happy emotions you’ve heard so much about, are told “this is the best age,” ”enjoy it while it lasts” and “they all get more difficult from here…” How will you feel? -- -- 16 The Parenting Portal We are Mumie; a team of experienced GPs who after having our own babies made it our mission to help women navigate their postnatal recovery Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "

I was absolutely, irrevocably in love with that baby. I can close my eyes and feel her whisper-fine hair tickling my collarbones as we rocked in her dark bedroom.

Ask me then, ask me now, ask me 10 years from now — I could do that new-baby phase 100 times over. I loved every second of it, and I really mean that. I really mean that, and I really mean this, too: I am a “one-and-done” mom. Never again will I rock my sweet-swelling baby in a nursery while the rest of the world goes by. Millie will be an only child. Please do not assume that this was an easy decision, either. I struggle with it daily. Millie is a social butterfly. She craves playmates like I crave coffee the second I peel my eyelids open in the morning. Her biggest complaint, when I push her toward independence: “I just don’t want to be alone!” Talk about a knife in the heart. But here’s the thing. I write to you from the room in my house that is farthest away from my daughter’s room, at a time when I would really love nothing more than to be in my bed. Yet, even here, Millie dominates: I find myself flanked by a toy train set, a mini trampoline, about 17 sheets of paper she is turning into a “book,” and several coffee filters, for some reason. My work-issued laptop gave me a fright when I opened it, immediately blaring the “Bluey” theme song and harshing the cool writerly vibe I worked so hard to curate (i.e, I lit a candle and cracked open a beer). Why, you ask, would I bother coming down to write at all, if I am just going to sit here and whine about it? In the words of the Great Elise Myers: great question. I’d love to tell you. I need a side hustle. You see, my husband Tom and I are both teachers. I have taught since 2009, which makes 2024–2025 my (gulp) 16th year of teaching. Tom was a career switcher in his 30s, so this is only his 4th year teaching. I don’t know if it’s inflation, our old house, or what, but finances are tight lately. The hits just keep on coming, and they show no sign of slowing down in the near future. Pair that with the general doomsday vibe of current U.S. political sphere, my age, and my overall mental state (it’s touch and go, folks), and this is absolutely, irrevocably NOT the time to have a second child. I’ve done the math. We don’t have maternity leave, obviously, so I’d have to use my sick days for that. All 12 of them, after last year’s onslaught of stupid plagues. So, basically, we’re looking at about 10 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave, which costs me about $9K. Also, my insurance is not great, so I really can’t even imagine how much that hospital stay would cost. Let’s tack another $5K onto that. We’re currently at $14K. Now add on double the doctor visits, another 5 years of childcare, when we are FINALLY done… You get the picture. It ain’t happening. I’m not alone, either. There has been a worldwide trend in recent years in parents choosing to stop at one child. According to Amanda Ruggeri for BBC, both the EU and Canada have upwards of 45% of parents choosing to have only one child. Comparatively, the U.S. has a much smaller (albeit still growing) percentage of about 20%. (“The Only-Child Family, ” Psychology Today). The reasons most frequently cited by parents for stopping at one child? Finances and a lack of support system. So, what about the onlies themselves?

Millie is not yet in Kindergarten, but she recognizes a growing list of sight words and is a beginning phonetic speller.

Let’s not mince words here. It’s a problem. We do our best; we set up playdates and we play with cousins constantly…but yeah, it’s a concern. This summer at home, she’s had a hard time with emotional outbursts, and I can’t help but wonder if it may be, in part, because she is not getting the social time she desperately craves.

140,The Real Diabolic Lie about Being a Stay-At-Home Mom,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Julie Calidonio Follow Middle-Pause -- 106 Share Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker recently made controversial comments at a college commencement. He insinuated that women would feel most fulfilled in their mother and homemaker roles rather than in the workplace. He went on to reference his wife, Isabelle, as being the primary caretaker of their children. Through her role as a homemaker, he argued she is happier and will attain salvation. Butker’s comments echo the “tradwifes” movement on TikTok where women post about the benefits of being traditional wives. These videos highlight women taking on traditional roles of being the homemaker and primary caretaker while the husband is the primary wage earner. As a stay-at-home parent, I don’t judge anyone for choosing career or child-rearing. Part of being a feminist is valuing that women have the independence to make their own choices. My qualm with the “traditional wives” movement and comments like Butker’s is they lead young women to believe that if they choose family over themselves everything will be copacetic. If they take care of their family, they will be protected. -- -- 106 Middle-Pause Lawyer turned writer, Julie's essays keep it real about motherhood and adulting.

My heart raced as I held the envelope in my hands, the culmination of months of anticipation and anxiety. My wife, Roopa, wasn’t as excited as I was; she got to watch our babies closely at every check-up. In our previous scan, she had mentioned seeing the genitals of both babies and that they were boys. I laughed, teasing her about how she could be so sure. Maybe it was just another part of their tiny bodies, I argued. She challenged me, her eyes gleaming with a mixture of certainty and mischief. Deep down, I prayed she was wrong. I always dreamed of having at least one daughter. Now, with the 3D imaging of our little ones in hand, I felt a flood of emotions—nervousness, excitement, love, and an unexplainable fear. The reality of becoming a father was hitting me harder than ever. As we entered the third trimester, everything felt more imminent. They would be here soon, within three months. But I found myself in a state of constant worry. How would I handle everything? I loved Roopa deeply, and as her belly grew, so did my affection and concern for her. Every movement she made, every expression on her face, I noticed and analyzed, fearing the unknown. The baby shower was planned for the following week. Everyone was excited, but my mind was clouded with anxiety. I masked it well, not wanting Roopa to feel any additional stress. She needed me to be strong, and I was determined to be her rock. One evening, as we lay in bed, leaning against the wall, Roopa asked me which apparel looked best on her from the ones she had shown me earlier. My mind was elsewhere, preoccupied with a thousand thoughts. ""Anything you like,"" I replied absentmindedly. Her face fell, the disappointment evident in her eyes. She wanted reassurance, a connection, and I had failed to give her that. Silently, she slipped under the sheets and turned away, leaving me with a pang of guilt and a resolve to be more present. ..

143,Chapter 1: The Scan,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in VINAY KUMAR VENKATARAMANA Follow -- Listen Share It was the day I had the 3D scan reports of our pregnancy. My heart raced as I held the envelope in my hands, the culmination of months of anticipation and anxiety. My wife, Roopa, wasn’t as excited as I was; she got to watch our babies closely at every check-up. In our previous scan, she had mentioned seeing the genitals of both babies and that they were boys. I laughed, teasing her about how she could be so sure. Maybe it was just another part of their tiny bodies, I argued. She challenged me, her eyes gleaming with a mixture of certainty and mischief. Deep down, I prayed she was wrong. I always dreamed of having at least one daughter. Now, with the 3D imaging of our little ones in hand, I felt a flood of emotions—nervousness, excitement, love, and an unexplainable fear. The reality of becoming a father was hitting me harder than ever. As we entered the third trimester, everything felt more imminent. They would be here soon, within three months. But I found myself in a state of constant worry. How would I handle everything? I loved Roopa deeply, and as her belly grew, so did my affection and concern for her. Every movement she made, every expression on her face, I noticed and analyzed, fearing the unknown. The baby shower was planned for the following week. Everyone was excited, but my mind was clouded with anxiety. I masked it well, not wanting Roopa to feel any additional stress. She needed me to be strong, and I was determined to be her rock. One evening, as we lay in bed, leaning against the wall, Roopa asked me which apparel looked best on her from the ones she had shown me earlier. My mind was elsewhere, preoccupied with a thousand thoughts. ""Anything you like,"" I replied absentmindedly. Her face fell, the disappointment evident in her eyes. She wanted reassurance, a connection, and I had failed to give her that. Silently, she slipped under the sheets and turned away, leaving me with a pang of guilt and a resolve to be more present. ..

145,Things No One Tells You About Having a Third Baby,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Caitlin Houston Follow -- Listen Share There are things no one tells you about having a third baby and if they did — you might not believe them anyways. Most women don’t want advice when at the end of pregnancy, especially when she is 37 and having her third. It can feel overwhelming to think about what’s to come when you haven’t even met the newest member of your family. After the arrival of baby number three, I discovered a bunch of unexpected surprises. While I should have expected more laundry and a messier house, our washing machine never rests. And the floors are always covered in crumbs. Here are 8 things no one tells you about having a third baby (don’t worry it’s not all so bad). Even though you already have children, nothing can prepare you for a new newborn phase — especially after a five year hiatus. I remember thinking the first few months would be like riding a bike; I would hop on the Momcycle and take off without any wobbling. But, every baby is different. Every postpartum period is different. And my experience with two kids did not prepare me for having three kids whatsoever. Most of my Mom friends with multiples said the transition from two to three wasn’t too hard. And good for them — because our transition from two to three was difficult. It is still difficult. For the first few months I kept waiting to feel settled into life as a family of five. Then about eleven months in, when things finally felt normal, I blinked and felt lost again. Three kids is an ongoing adventure, especially when our baby turned into a tiny fearless babbling human. We are close to being two years in as parents with three kids and I still feel like we in a period of transition. Don’t get me wrong, we do have a better grasp on juggling three kids — but there are so many adjustments that will continue to happen with the passing of time. The oldest never played in the bathroom. The second liked to throw things in the toilet. The third… let’s just say she knows exactly what toilet water tastes like. My parents always said they were more laid-back and flexible with my younger sister. But my husband and I are two years in with three kids and I would be lying if I said I was more easy going with our third. Arbor is our most active, most curious, and the fastest child we have ever made. We have to be firm and set very clear boundaries or this one is going to take us on a wild ride. For example, Arbor said, “No” before we could tell her, “No.” She already knew what was coming and now says, “Please Mommy?” when she is doing something naughty. It’s important to remember that with each child, your parenting style and expectations may shift; every child is different, so there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to parenting. It’s all hands on deck with three kids in the house — and sometimes it means everyone doing different things in different places. Truly, I never anticipated (or thought about) how little I would see my husband once our third was born. But once she was here, Brandon continued to work full time AND shuttle the older sisters around to school/dance/etc. We had to make an effort to spend time together — even if it just meant being in the same room while I nursed Arbor for the 3947th time that day. I really wish someone told me mom-perfection is pointless when I was pregnant the first time around. Perhaps it would have spared me the silly thought that I could try to “get it right” with my third. The truth is the best Moms don’t get it right. Mistakes are normal when you’re a parent. If you set the motherhood bar too high with unattainable goals and expectations, you’ll ultimately feel horrible every time you don’t meet them. Instead of being perfect, just be chill — be loving, be funny, show your kids you’re human with real feelings and admit that you sometimes make mistakes. In the end you’ll be the best Mom no matter what. I used to be on time for parties with a perfectly wrapped gift or warm delicious side dish. My girls were dressed in clean clothes with matching socks and a bow. Nowadays, I am lucky if I remember to change out of my slippers before I leave the house. And you know what — I’ve done it and it’s OKAY. You get used to things not being exactly how you used to like them and learn quickly that having low expectations is the way to go. Read: How I Really Felt Having a Third Baby after 6 months. All I have to say is — I feel for the parents who have three under five. Our house is rarely quiet, but little people make more noise than a 7 and 9 year old who enjoy silently drawing/reading from time to time. I’m not talking from stress — I’m referring to the overwhelming sense of love, pride, and joy you will experience when you see your three children together. I’ll never forget the first time I noticed my daughters playing together on their own. It wasn’t forced, it just naturally happened, and it made my chest ache with the most wonderful feelings. I don’t recall when I had the epiphany that having a third child is worth every challenge and bump in the road — but it happened. One day I looked around and knew I was right where I am supposed to be. Even though you feel three times as exhausted and three times as busy when you have your third child, you will also undoubtedly feel three times in love. -- -- Caitlin Houston is a Mom of three and creator of Connecticut based life + style site Caitlin Houston Blog.

146,Making Friends,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Kelsey Breseman Follow -- Listen Share ""Oh, hang on, they're about to score,"" I pause my conversation with the French girl next to me. We're in the garden area of a pub watching the England versus Switzerland match in the Euros. The wifi is slow in the garden, so we have about one minute between hearing people celebrate inside and actually seeing the play on the outside screen. It's perfect. None of us are all that invested in the match, but we don't want to miss the big moments, either. One minute later, England scores on the outside screen. The inebriated table in the corner starts singing. We cheer with everybody else, laugh, and get back to our conversation. This is a group of strangers I met a few hours ago, at a lunch hosted by Girl Gone International. It's basically a Facebook group, a chapter per city, where women and nonbinary people can meet to make new friends. This one was a picnic on Hampstead Heath, except it ended up at a restaurant because of the unseasonable July rains. The woman from Colombia asked if anyone wanted to carry on afterwards to watch the game, so now I'm here with her, the French woman, a woman from Italy, and a friend the Colombian woman invited. As it happens, we all speak Spanish, so we've been chatting in both languages just for fun. There are a number of these groups, mostly on Facebook and Instagram. There's The Girls That Walk, that go for weekly walks in Battersea Park. There's the London Girls Book Club, a more heavily sponsored group that also does yoga, paint and sip, and pub nights. The massive and on-the-nose London Lonely Girls Club is a Facebook group where most posts start with some variation of ""this is intimidating, but I'm going to put myself out there..."" and go on with a multiparagraph bio that wouldn't be out of place on a dating site. Most posts there get 20+ comments from other Lonely Girls along the lines of ""I like your vibe, I sent you a DM, let's hang out."" London is a passing through place. Some of the women I've met have been here since before Brexit, and they say they have to find new friends every three to five years— so they come back out to these groups. It actually works. I have no idea what the men do, but the womxn's groups are hopping. I posted a picture of a pasta maker with the message ""DM if you want to come over and make pasta together"" in Girl Gone International, and it got more than 50 likes, with five or so people DM'ing to meet up. Even my Lonely Girls post back in the first trimester woes of April, ""would love if there's anybody around daytimes who wants to make plans to go walk in the park and then cut them short because of nausea😅"" was effective. I ended up meeting a recent arrival from New York just dipping her toes into solo international travel. She's off city-hopping Europe now, but for a few weeks, she was my go-to person to text for an afternoon walk; she lived nearby and needed somebody to hang out with just as much as I did. Now that I'm back and feeling human again, I can meet people more naturally, by going out and doing things. There's a cemetery-turned-park nearby where big trees have taken over and grown through the gravestones, resulting in a surprisingly lovely wild corner of East London. They take volunteers every week: so far I've done litter pick, pruned the wild plum trees, and pulled nettles and hogweed. While soaking in the smell of trees and the satisfaction of being useful to a forest, I've met a cryptography researcher who lives in the same complex as me, a young woman who is into foraging and has just moved to the area with her partner, and a psychology professor who recently lived in Tasmania but is now expecting his first baby in the next ten days. He introduced me to his wife; we got smoothies together last night, and we're going to prenatal yoga later today. They're helping me navigate pregnancy in the National Health System: apparently, if I report pregnancy as a ""symptom,"" my GP will have to get back to me within 48 hours, which should result in a referral to a midwife to guide me through the process. I'm aggressive in my efforts to make community. I get energy from social interaction, and need excuses to leave the apartment. Through years of speaking at tech conferences, I learned the indispensable skill of feeling comfortable breaking into conversations with strangers. And I'm conscious that the second trimester is a limited window; by the time my mobility drops again, I will need to know people well enough to invite them over, maybe ask them for help. As my mother suggested, pregnancy helps with the social scene. Now that it's not tying me to the couch, it's an easy thing to have in common with anyone who's been pregnant, or a wild story to tell with people not on that path. I've been added to WhatsApp and Facebook groups for parents and for mums in my postcode area and in my apartment complex, to Adventure Mums, to Mums Who Climb. It's not exactly friendship, but it's a place to start. A lot of these groups have events that anyone can come to. The air is heavy with the fragrance of roses as I pass the edge of Regent's park. ""Congratulations,"" smiles a bellhop at one of the fancy lodgings, nodding at the ""Baby on Board"" pin I'm still wearing from riding the Tube. It's raining, but the rain makes me feel at home as it slowly drenched my hair. I'm not the only one. A woman sitting umbrella-less on a bench shares a smile. A cluster of women in hijabs join me under a Japanese pine to shelter for a moment of downpour in the garden. I'm alone today, but it isn't lonely. It's summer, my body works, and pregnancy does finally feel like a kind of glow.

147,I Can’t Wait to be a Father…Someday.,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ned Donovan Follow -- 15 Listen Share Content Warning: This essay discusses Fatherhood, Parenting, and Infertility. From as far back as I can remember, I’ve always wanted to be a dad. My relationship to parenthood, however, is different. My parents were wonderful people and two of my closest friends. I cherish every day I had with them and wish there could have been more. Like everyone, each had their unique set of issues, and they weren’t particularly attentive or engaged. My upbringing involved being raised by a revolving door of teachers, friends’ parents, my parents’ friends, mentors, coaches, and of course, sometimes my mom and dad. Consequently, I’ve considered many people as parental figures throughout my life. There are plenty of adults I lovingly call “Dad” including my biological father. From that, I’ve always known that I’d be comfortable with whatever path to fatherhood life brought me on. When my wife and I began dating, she was in the middle of her third egg freezing cycle. She has always wanted to be a mother, with being a pregnant person one of her life-long dreams. At age 30 and single, she decided to advocate for herself to have a fertility checkup. Following her second New York Marathon, she was in prime physical condition, her doctors reassured her. She had nothing to worry about. However, the tone quickly changed as she began a soon-to-be canceled egg freezing. She did not have the expected response to the heavy does on medication. She was subsequently diagnosed with Diminished Ovarian Reserve, a condition where the quantity of a woman’s eggs are lower than expected for her age. This marked the beginning of her multi-year solo journey to freeze her eggs. My wife has been on the record about her diagnosis for years. She is an incredible woman and a champion for people to have the opportunity to control their fertility future. You should watch this video she filmed for TheSkimm back in 2020 to know about more about her and her journey. Our third date was to my wife’s apartment. That sentence alone could be enough to scandalize a story, cuing a “fade-to-black” sequence filled with entendres and playful metaphors. The reality is far less sexy. We had our third date at her apartment because she was in the middle of an egg-freezing cycle, and needed to give herself shots at a specific time. So I sat on her couch as we got to know each other through a closed bathroom door while she injected herself with an elephant-sized amount of hormones. It was a fascinating way to broach the topic of how we both wanted to have kids. It put the topic pretty front and center very early in our relationship. In 2021 we got engaged and quickly eloped. “Is she pregnant?” Many of my friends and family jokingly asked. “No, we’re just not 23” I often shot back, my way of saying that we both knew the things we wanted and a long drawn out wedding process wasn’t one of them. What I wanted to say was “No, and that’s a sensitive topic.” When we got married we were already months into our decision to start a family in consultation with our fertility doctor. As a quick sidenote, there is literally nothing less sexy than timed intercourse. Sex is fun and natural. It is less so when on a very specific clock and schedule and then reported to an overseeing physician. :P We had five frozen eggs in storage but we were not using them to start, instead saving the eggs as a backup plan. We were given many warnings about the probable challenges due to my wife’s well-documented fertility issues. We followed all instructions to the letter, my wife undertook an extremely restrictive diet to supposedly improve egg quality and fertility chances, and we regularly tested to see if we were successful. We were not. Throughout this whole process I have often wondered how I would talk about it with my parents. As far as I know, they had pretty routine pregnancies. However they both felt the unique pain of losing a daughter at a very young age. How would we connect over this exhausting and emotionally fraught period in my life? I wouldn’t say Dad was incredibly communicative with his feelings. Our serious talks would come, usually in the car, after we’d sat in silence for a couple minutes and it was clear something was eating away at him. That was where we talked about my sister’s passing, or my parent’s divorce, or his complicated relationship to family. In reflecting on those conversations a theme always emerged. Dad had a strongly felt notion of what fatherhood was, and he was constantly grading himself as a success or failure on those metrics. I found those conversations exhausting, as he was asking me to assuage his fears about his parenting. In my younger days I was less willing to let him off those hooks, and it led to a bunch of awkward silences during the limited times I got to see him in person. My wife and I pivoted our attention to IVF. As the doctors put it, it’s really hard for a couple, even a young couple like us, to conceive naturally when dealing with a condition like my wife’s. The odds are just stacked against us, and with medical intervention we can increase our chances. We had 5 eggs in storage, and we would let science solve our fertility woes. It was time for Ned to get medically cleared for this process, so I needed to get all my tests done, including bloodwork, medical history, and the oft-made-fun-of semen sample. The afternoon after my deposit (their words, not mine). I received a call from our clinic. The woman on the other end was laughing. Clinic: Hey Ned, We need you to come back in tomorrow. We screwed something up.Me: Oh? What happened?Clinic: We’re not sure, we botched the test, so we need you to do a second one. Obviously free-of-charge. So back I went the next day to make another deposit (I really hate the terminology.) That afternoon, another call. Clinic: Hey Ned, so we didn’t actually screw up the test. There’s something wrong. You see in the average semen sample you can expect to find tens to hundreds of millions of sperm. However Ned? I didn’t have a low sperm count. I had a no sperm count. Zero sperm were registered by either test. Alarm bells went off for my wife and I that we didn’t even know to be worried about. Something’s wrong…with Ned? We’ve been at this for years now, how is it this is the first time anyone even raised that possibility? Readers: I probably don’t need to tell most of you how overwhelmingly sexist the medical industry is, but this was the first time it had hit me full in the face. For this entire time the mentality of our doctors was of course the problem couldn’t be Ned. Not when she has such well documented fertility issues of her own. The saga of my time in the male fertility clinics is for another article. I’ve written it like 6 times, but always stopped myself from publishing when I realize just another facet of how messed up the process was. However it was another 7 months of tests and a surprise invasive surgery to discover that I have a genetic condition where my sperm do not mature. The condition is super rare, and there’s no cure of any kind for it. Ned cannot have biological children. While dealing with that emotional blow, we pivoted immediately to finding a sperm donor. We had multiple people we love and trust in our lives that we had reached out to as potential donors should my surgeries be unsuccessful. Next we had new legal pathways to cross, tests to be run and coordinated but now for a third party, lawyers have to get involved, individual therapy, group therapy, more clinics. We racked up many tens of thousands of dollars in medical expenses in the course of just a couple of years. Thankfully we have good health insurance and through my wife’s employer, access to fertility benefits. I often think about how everything we went through is completely unattainable to anyone with our same issues, wants, and desires, but with less means and access. How fortunate we are to be able to go on this journey and actually have options available to us. I also think about the amount of time my wife and I spent dealing with incompetent medical offices, insurance claims, paperwork, coordination of medical visits, and pure raw emotions felt at each setback. It was a full-time job and we already both had one of those. We were absolutely wrecked, emotionally and physically by this process. I found myself wondering is this how my parents felt through my sister’s medical sagas. In a time before the internet, how did they manage needing to move at the speed of light and being headed off by the system. Did they find this process bringing them together, as it had with my wife and I. Was it the start of the seeds for their divorce years later? I wish I could’ve compared our experiences. To feel a little less alone in this process that we spoke so little about except to a very close circle of people. After everything we had (and thawed all) 7 eggs and attempted the scientific process. 1 embryo survived. A lower quality embryo had formed than we would hope for (a 4BB quality that we lovingly named 4BB-8), but it was our best shot, our only shot. We got McDonald’s french fries, and did all the other superstitions that people recommend. We celebrated. We went home and rested and watched movies. We pinned the picture of 4BB-8 up to the back of our door in a place of honor. We followed all the instructions from the doctors while we waited for the pregnancy test two weeks later. “I’m sorry to say I’m not calling with good news.” Our doctor’s voice rang out from the speaker phone. She explained that the pregnancy test was negative, that all the positive signs we’d had were a result of the medications my wife was on and now must stop. The call ended saying we would reconnect in a week to discuss next steps. “Sorry 4BB-8. We just didn’t come through for you.” My wife said, as chipper as she could muster, while removing the picture from our door to place into a scrapbook. That moment is seared into my brain as maybe the saddest I’ve ever experienced. We decided to go on our Honeymoon after that, stating that if we were going to be sad, we might as well be sad on a beach. That was November of 2022. The road has not cleared since. All efforts to conceive naturally or artificially have failed and we’ve reached the end of the line for those efforts. I would not say we are at peace with it, but we’ve taken the time to mourn it. Our attentions have now turned to alternative methods of becoming parents. Who would have known, all those years ago, that the realization I had about myself would be the saving grace for my mental health through all this. I’ve never needed my children to be biologically related to me. A statement as cavalier when I thought of it in my teenaged years as it is the calm in the storm for me now. For my wife, we have had to mourn her life-long dream of being a pregnant person. That has been the hardest part of this process for me. As a partner you want to support and uplift dreams, but what do you do when every effort to do so is futile? It was always so easy to say “maybe just one more” because “you never know” is the thing they say at every fertility clinic. Positivity and hope are crucial to this process. But it’s all the more crushing when no matter how much you put into the universe, it can’t sway the bad. We have begun the adoption process. A long, fraught road that can have just as many pitfalls and emotional disasters as the one we just finished. We’re stronger as a couple and as individuals for the experience we’ve had, and while getting ready for the next battle we’ve taken a few months off to just enjoy our lives. As I look forward to what comes next, my mind comes back to something my mother wrote in an article for the Portland Press Herald in a Mother’s Day essay about losing her daughter and then having a third child, me. “Never was a child so desired, or so prenatally subjected to tests.” While our eventual children will not be prenatally tested, I can’t help but feel that no child has ever been so desired. That the trials and tribulations that we have been through will all be worth it the day we officially become parents. And in writing this, I’ve realized that it’s this feeling by which I would have connected with my parents over this process. That feeling of want and desire for a kid, your kid, and having to overcome the trials of Sisyphus to get there. Someday, we’ll be able to point to all this and explain to our child how loved they are and how loved they’ve been since before they were ever in our lives. And I’ll be able to introduce them to the grandparents who won’t get to meet them through that feeling. I may not have one more chat with Mom and Dad, but I do get to find the moments that resonate. The ones I know they experienced and the ones I can only extrapolate. This process has been grueling, miserable, and I wouldn’t wish it on absolutely anyone. But in some ways its made me feel closer to my parents, a feat that becomes harder and harder the farther from their passing I get. Someday I will get to celebrate this day as a father. I really really really look forward to that day. As a final note, this is an official statement to my community saying, if there is a baby in your community in need of adoption for whatever reason. My wife and I would love to be introduced. A huge thank you in advance. -- -- 15 He/Him • Actor • Producer • Co-Founder Audition Cat, Charging Moose Media, Play+1 • Board Member New Jersey Web Festival • https://neddonovan.com/links Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "

The oldest never played in the bathroom. The second liked to throw things in the toilet. The third… let’s just say she knows exactly what toilet water tastes like. My parents always said they were more laid-back and flexible with my younger sister. But my husband and I are two years in with three kids and I would be lying if I said I was more easy going with our third. Arbor is our most active, most curious, and the fastest child we have ever made. We have to be firm and set very clear boundaries or this one is going to take us on a wild ride. For example, Arbor said, “No” before we could tell her, “No.” She already knew what was coming and now says, “Please Mommy?” when she is doing something naughty. It’s important to remember that with each child, your parenting style and expectations may shift; every child is different, so there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to parenting. It’s all hands on deck with three kids in the house — and sometimes it means everyone doing different things in different places. Truly, I never anticipated (or thought about) how little I would see my husband once our third was born. But once she was here, Brandon continued to work full time AND shuttle the older sisters around to school/dance/etc. We had to make an effort to spend time together — even if it just meant being in the same room while I nursed Arbor for the 3947th time that day. I really wish someone told me mom-perfection is pointless when I was pregnant the first time around. Perhaps it would have spared me the silly thought that I could try to “get it right” with my third. The truth is the best Moms don’t get it right. Mistakes are normal when you’re a parent. If you set the motherhood bar too high with unattainable goals and expectations, you’ll ultimately feel horrible every time you don’t meet them. Instead of being perfect, just be chill — be loving, be funny, show your kids you’re human with real feelings and admit that you sometimes make mistakes. In the end you’ll be the best Mom no matter what. I used to be on time for parties with a perfectly wrapped gift or warm delicious side dish. My girls were dressed in clean clothes with matching socks and a bow. Nowadays, I am lucky if I remember to change out of my slippers before I leave the house. And you know what — I’ve done it and it’s OKAY. You get used to things not being exactly how you used to like them and learn quickly that having low expectations is the way to go. Read: How I Really Felt Having a Third Baby after 6 months. All I have to say is — I feel for the parents who have three under five. Our house is rarely quiet, but little people make more noise than a 7 and 9 year old who enjoy silently drawing/reading from time to time. I’m not talking from stress — I’m referring to the overwhelming sense of love, pride, and joy you will experience when you see your three children together. I’ll never forget the first time I noticed my daughters playing together on their own. It wasn’t forced, it just naturally happened, and it made my chest ache with the most wonderful feelings. I don’t recall when I had the epiphany that having a third child is worth every challenge and bump in the road — but it happened. One day I looked around and knew I was right where I am supposed to be. Even though you feel three times as exhausted and three times as busy when you have your third child, you will also undoubtedly feel three times in love. -- -- Caitlin Houston is a Mom of three and creator of Connecticut based life + style site Caitlin Houston Blog.

151,Making Friends,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Kelsey Breseman Follow -- Listen Share ""Oh, hang on, they're about to score,"" I pause my conversation with the French girl next to me. We're in the garden area of a pub watching the England versus Switzerland match in the Euros. The wifi is slow in the garden, so we have about one minute between hearing people celebrate inside and actually seeing the play on the outside screen. It's perfect. None of us are all that invested in the match, but we don't want to miss the big moments, either. One minute later, England scores on the outside screen. The inebriated table in the corner starts singing. We cheer with everybody else, laugh, and get back to our conversation. This is a group of strangers I met a few hours ago, at a lunch hosted by Girl Gone International. It's basically a Facebook group, a chapter per city, where women and nonbinary people can meet to make new friends. This one was a picnic on Hampstead Heath, except it ended up at a restaurant because of the unseasonable July rains. The woman from Colombia asked if anyone wanted to carry on afterwards to watch the game, so now I'm here with her, the French woman, a woman from Italy, and a friend the Colombian woman invited. As it happens, we all speak Spanish, so we've been chatting in both languages just for fun. There are a number of these groups, mostly on Facebook and Instagram. There's The Girls That Walk, that go for weekly walks in Battersea Park. There's the London Girls Book Club, a more heavily sponsored group that also does yoga, paint and sip, and pub nights. The massive and on-the-nose London Lonely Girls Club is a Facebook group where most posts start with some variation of ""this is intimidating, but I'm going to put myself out there..."" and go on with a multiparagraph bio that wouldn't be out of place on a dating site. Most posts there get 20+ comments from other Lonely Girls along the lines of ""I like your vibe, I sent you a DM, let's hang out."" London is a passing through place. Some of the women I've met have been here since before Brexit, and they say they have to find new friends every three to five years— so they come back out to these groups. It actually works. I have no idea what the men do, but the womxn's groups are hopping. I posted a picture of a pasta maker with the message ""DM if you want to come over and make pasta together"" in Girl Gone International, and it got more than 50 likes, with five or so people DM'ing to meet up. Even my Lonely Girls post back in the first trimester woes of April, ""would love if there's anybody around daytimes who wants to make plans to go walk in the park and then cut them short because of nausea😅"" was effective. I ended up meeting a recent arrival from New York just dipping her toes into solo international travel. She's off city-hopping Europe now, but for a few weeks, she was my go-to person to text for an afternoon walk; she lived nearby and needed somebody to hang out with just as much as I did. Now that I'm back and feeling human again, I can meet people more naturally, by going out and doing things. There's a cemetery-turned-park nearby where big trees have taken over and grown through the gravestones, resulting in a surprisingly lovely wild corner of East London. They take volunteers every week: so far I've done litter pick, pruned the wild plum trees, and pulled nettles and hogweed. While soaking in the smell of trees and the satisfaction of being useful to a forest, I've met a cryptography researcher who lives in the same complex as me, a young woman who is into foraging and has just moved to the area with her partner, and a psychology professor who recently lived in Tasmania but is now expecting his first baby in the next ten days. He introduced me to his wife; we got smoothies together last night, and we're going to prenatal yoga later today. They're helping me navigate pregnancy in the National Health System: apparently, if I report pregnancy as a ""symptom,"" my GP will have to get back to me within 48 hours, which should result in a referral to a midwife to guide me through the process. I'm aggressive in my efforts to make community. I get energy from social interaction, and need excuses to leave the apartment. Through years of speaking at tech conferences, I learned the indispensable skill of feeling comfortable breaking into conversations with strangers. And I'm conscious that the second trimester is a limited window; by the time my mobility drops again, I will need to know people well enough to invite them over, maybe ask them for help. As my mother suggested, pregnancy helps with the social scene. Now that it's not tying me to the couch, it's an easy thing to have in common with anyone who's been pregnant, or a wild story to tell with people not on that path. I've been added to WhatsApp and Facebook groups for parents and for mums in my postcode area and in my apartment complex, to Adventure Mums, to Mums Who Climb. It's not exactly friendship, but it's a place to start. A lot of these groups have events that anyone can come to. The air is heavy with the fragrance of roses as I pass the edge of Regent's park. ""Congratulations,"" smiles a bellhop at one of the fancy lodgings, nodding at the ""Baby on Board"" pin I'm still wearing from riding the Tube. It's raining, but the rain makes me feel at home as it slowly drenched my hair. I'm not the only one. A woman sitting umbrella-less on a bench shares a smile. A cluster of women in hijabs join me under a Japanese pine to shelter for a moment of downpour in the garden. I'm alone today, but it isn't lonely. It's summer, my body works, and pregnancy does finally feel like a kind of glow.

152,I Can’t Wait to be a Father…Someday.,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ned Donovan Follow -- 15 Listen Share Content Warning: This essay discusses Fatherhood, Parenting, and Infertility. From as far back as I can remember, I’ve always wanted to be a dad. My relationship to parenthood, however, is different. My parents were wonderful people and two of my closest friends. I cherish every day I had with them and wish there could have been more. Like everyone, each had their unique set of issues, and they weren’t particularly attentive or engaged. My upbringing involved being raised by a revolving door of teachers, friends’ parents, my parents’ friends, mentors, coaches, and of course, sometimes my mom and dad. Consequently, I’ve considered many people as parental figures throughout my life. There are plenty of adults I lovingly call “Dad” including my biological father. From that, I’ve always known that I’d be comfortable with whatever path to fatherhood life brought me on. When my wife and I began dating, she was in the middle of her third egg freezing cycle. She has always wanted to be a mother, with being a pregnant person one of her life-long dreams. At age 30 and single, she decided to advocate for herself to have a fertility checkup. Following her second New York Marathon, she was in prime physical condition, her doctors reassured her. She had nothing to worry about. However, the tone quickly changed as she began a soon-to-be canceled egg freezing. She did not have the expected response to the heavy does on medication. She was subsequently diagnosed with Diminished Ovarian Reserve, a condition where the quantity of a woman’s eggs are lower than expected for her age. This marked the beginning of her multi-year solo journey to freeze her eggs. My wife has been on the record about her diagnosis for years. She is an incredible woman and a champion for people to have the opportunity to control their fertility future. You should watch this video she filmed for TheSkimm back in 2020 to know about more about her and her journey. Our third date was to my wife’s apartment. That sentence alone could be enough to scandalize a story, cuing a “fade-to-black” sequence filled with entendres and playful metaphors. The reality is far less sexy. We had our third date at her apartment because she was in the middle of an egg-freezing cycle, and needed to give herself shots at a specific time. So I sat on her couch as we got to know each other through a closed bathroom door while she injected herself with an elephant-sized amount of hormones. It was a fascinating way to broach the topic of how we both wanted to have kids. It put the topic pretty front and center very early in our relationship. In 2021 we got engaged and quickly eloped. “Is she pregnant?” Many of my friends and family jokingly asked. “No, we’re just not 23” I often shot back, my way of saying that we both knew the things we wanted and a long drawn out wedding process wasn’t one of them. What I wanted to say was “No, and that’s a sensitive topic.” When we got married we were already months into our decision to start a family in consultation with our fertility doctor. As a quick sidenote, there is literally nothing less sexy than timed intercourse. Sex is fun and natural. It is less so when on a very specific clock and schedule and then reported to an overseeing physician. :P We had five frozen eggs in storage but we were not using them to start, instead saving the eggs as a backup plan. We were given many warnings about the probable challenges due to my wife’s well-documented fertility issues. We followed all instructions to the letter, my wife undertook an extremely restrictive diet to supposedly improve egg quality and fertility chances, and we regularly tested to see if we were successful. We were not. Throughout this whole process I have often wondered how I would talk about it with my parents. As far as I know, they had pretty routine pregnancies. However they both felt the unique pain of losing a daughter at a very young age. How would we connect over this exhausting and emotionally fraught period in my life? I wouldn’t say Dad was incredibly communicative with his feelings. Our serious talks would come, usually in the car, after we’d sat in silence for a couple minutes and it was clear something was eating away at him. That was where we talked about my sister’s passing, or my parent’s divorce, or his complicated relationship to family. In reflecting on those conversations a theme always emerged. Dad had a strongly felt notion of what fatherhood was, and he was constantly grading himself as a success or failure on those metrics. I found those conversations exhausting, as he was asking me to assuage his fears about his parenting. In my younger days I was less willing to let him off those hooks, and it led to a bunch of awkward silences during the limited times I got to see him in person. My wife and I pivoted our attention to IVF. As the doctors put it, it’s really hard for a couple, even a young couple like us, to conceive naturally when dealing with a condition like my wife’s. The odds are just stacked against us, and with medical intervention we can increase our chances. We had 5 eggs in storage, and we would let science solve our fertility woes. It was time for Ned to get medically cleared for this process, so I needed to get all my tests done, including bloodwork, medical history, and the oft-made-fun-of semen sample. The afternoon after my deposit (their words, not mine). I received a call from our clinic. The woman on the other end was laughing. Clinic: Hey Ned, We need you to come back in tomorrow. We screwed something up.Me: Oh? What happened?Clinic: We’re not sure, we botched the test, so we need you to do a second one. Obviously free-of-charge. So back I went the next day to make another deposit (I really hate the terminology.) That afternoon, another call. Clinic: Hey Ned, so we didn’t actually screw up the test. There’s something wrong. You see in the average semen sample you can expect to find tens to hundreds of millions of sperm. However Ned? I didn’t have a low sperm count. I had a no sperm count. Zero sperm were registered by either test. Alarm bells went off for my wife and I that we didn’t even know to be worried about. Something’s wrong…with Ned? We’ve been at this for years now, how is it this is the first time anyone even raised that possibility? Readers: I probably don’t need to tell most of you how overwhelmingly sexist the medical industry is, but this was the first time it had hit me full in the face. For this entire time the mentality of our doctors was of course the problem couldn’t be Ned. Not when she has such well documented fertility issues of her own. The saga of my time in the male fertility clinics is for another article. I’ve written it like 6 times, but always stopped myself from publishing when I realize just another facet of how messed up the process was. However it was another 7 months of tests and a surprise invasive surgery to discover that I have a genetic condition where my sperm do not mature. The condition is super rare, and there’s no cure of any kind for it. Ned cannot have biological children. While dealing with that emotional blow, we pivoted immediately to finding a sperm donor. We had multiple people we love and trust in our lives that we had reached out to as potential donors should my surgeries be unsuccessful. Next we had new legal pathways to cross, tests to be run and coordinated but now for a third party, lawyers have to get involved, individual therapy, group therapy, more clinics. We racked up many tens of thousands of dollars in medical expenses in the course of just a couple of years. Thankfully we have good health insurance and through my wife’s employer, access to fertility benefits. I often think about how everything we went through is completely unattainable to anyone with our same issues, wants, and desires, but with less means and access. How fortunate we are to be able to go on this journey and actually have options available to us. I also think about the amount of time my wife and I spent dealing with incompetent medical offices, insurance claims, paperwork, coordination of medical visits, and pure raw emotions felt at each setback. It was a full-time job and we already both had one of those. We were absolutely wrecked, emotionally and physically by this process. I found myself wondering is this how my parents felt through my sister’s medical sagas. In a time before the internet, how did they manage needing to move at the speed of light and being headed off by the system. Did they find this process bringing them together, as it had with my wife and I. Was it the start of the seeds for their divorce years later? I wish I could’ve compared our experiences. To feel a little less alone in this process that we spoke so little about except to a very close circle of people. After everything we had (and thawed all) 7 eggs and attempted the scientific process. 1 embryo survived. A lower quality embryo had formed than we would hope for (a 4BB quality that we lovingly named 4BB-8), but it was our best shot, our only shot. We got McDonald’s french fries, and did all the other superstitions that people recommend. We celebrated. We went home and rested and watched movies. We pinned the picture of 4BB-8 up to the back of our door in a place of honor. We followed all the instructions from the doctors while we waited for the pregnancy test two weeks later. “I’m sorry to say I’m not calling with good news.” Our doctor’s voice rang out from the speaker phone. She explained that the pregnancy test was negative, that all the positive signs we’d had were a result of the medications my wife was on and now must stop. The call ended saying we would reconnect in a week to discuss next steps. “Sorry 4BB-8. We just didn’t come through for you.” My wife said, as chipper as she could muster, while removing the picture from our door to place into a scrapbook. That moment is seared into my brain as maybe the saddest I’ve ever experienced. We decided to go on our Honeymoon after that, stating that if we were going to be sad, we might as well be sad on a beach. That was November of 2022. The road has not cleared since. All efforts to conceive naturally or artificially have failed and we’ve reached the end of the line for those efforts. I would not say we are at peace with it, but we’ve taken the time to mourn it. Our attentions have now turned to alternative methods of becoming parents. Who would have known, all those years ago, that the realization I had about myself would be the saving grace for my mental health through all this. I’ve never needed my children to be biologically related to me. A statement as cavalier when I thought of it in my teenaged years as it is the calm in the storm for me now. For my wife, we have had to mourn her life-long dream of being a pregnant person. That has been the hardest part of this process for me. As a partner you want to support and uplift dreams, but what do you do when every effort to do so is futile? It was always so easy to say “maybe just one more” because “you never know” is the thing they say at every fertility clinic. Positivity and hope are crucial to this process. But it’s all the more crushing when no matter how much you put into the universe, it can’t sway the bad. We have begun the adoption process. A long, fraught road that can have just as many pitfalls and emotional disasters as the one we just finished. We’re stronger as a couple and as individuals for the experience we’ve had, and while getting ready for the next battle we’ve taken a few months off to just enjoy our lives. As I look forward to what comes next, my mind comes back to something my mother wrote in an article for the Portland Press Herald in a Mother’s Day essay about losing her daughter and then having a third child, me. “Never was a child so desired, or so prenatally subjected to tests.” While our eventual children will not be prenatally tested, I can’t help but feel that no child has ever been so desired. That the trials and tribulations that we have been through will all be worth it the day we officially become parents. And in writing this, I’ve realized that it’s this feeling by which I would have connected with my parents over this process. That feeling of want and desire for a kid, your kid, and having to overcome the trials of Sisyphus to get there. Someday, we’ll be able to point to all this and explain to our child how loved they are and how loved they’ve been since before they were ever in our lives. And I’ll be able to introduce them to the grandparents who won’t get to meet them through that feeling. I may not have one more chat with Mom and Dad, but I do get to find the moments that resonate. The ones I know they experienced and the ones I can only extrapolate. This process has been grueling, miserable, and I wouldn’t wish it on absolutely anyone. But in some ways its made me feel closer to my parents, a feat that becomes harder and harder the farther from their passing I get. Someday I will get to celebrate this day as a father. I really really really look forward to that day. As a final note, this is an official statement to my community saying, if there is a baby in your community in need of adoption for whatever reason. My wife and I would love to be introduced. A huge thank you in advance. -- -- 15 He/Him • Actor • Producer • Co-Founder Audition Cat, Charging Moose Media, Play+1 • Board Member New Jersey Web Festival • https://neddonovan.com/links Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "
153,Terrible and Beautiful,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jeff Dillon Follow -- Listen Share Childbirth is an absolute miracle. It’s a miracle for so many reasons. But maybe the most miraculous thing is the fact that women are willing to do it at all. Having watched my wife give birth for the fifth time — (yes, fifth time. She is amazing)— last week, I’m more amazed than ever at this reality. And I find myself reflecting on how she described the process shortly after. “It’s terrible,” she told me. “And it’s beautiful.” What a perfect description. Bringing a child into the world is painful, not just for those handful of excruciating hours leading up to birth, but the entire process of pregnancy. Over the past nine months, I watched my wife go from uncomfortable to nauseous to exhausted to really uncomfortable to achy to sleepless to ridiculously uncomfortable. And that was all before labor even began. When labor did start, I watched her experience that intense pain again. This is a pain she knows well, and yet even the knowledge of it can’t blunt its sharp piercing. Her body pushed and pulled and stretched, the pressure moving this little tiny human to the precipice of life in the world. And after hours of that pressure, the worst was still to come. The most painful part is right before the baby is born. This being our fifth — and almost certainly final — labor experience, I tried to soak in every moment. I watched each detail, taking mental pictures in my mind of this incredible event. But this birth was significant for other reasons too. It had been a challenging pregnancy, with questions about my wife and son’s health. And far heavier than this was the reality that we have two friends who are going through the most painful experience you could possibly face in life — both couples losing their young children in recent weeks. It’s strange to celebrate the birth of a child when you are seeing so plainly just how fragile and difficult life can be on this earth. I find questions like these flood my mind: Is it worth it? Are we just bringing this kid into a world of chaos and suffering? Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Is there any hope to be found? This is precisely what Jesus was getting at as he spoke to his disciples on the night of his betrayal. As he prepared them for his coming death on a cross, he used a profound metaphor to drive the point home: childbirth. “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy. When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come, but when she has delivered the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world. So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.”(John 16:20–22) Jesus didn’t promise his disciples that everything was going to go well. He prepares them for pain. But like a mother bringing a child into the world, he says the pain they are about to experience — the anguish they will feel — will be worth it. The sorrow will be replaced by a joy that can’t be taken away. Of course, this passage is primarily about his crucifixion and resurrection, but it’s about more than that. Jesus isn’t only preparing his disciples for the next three days, he’s preparing them for the rest of their lives. He is preparing them for a world that will hate them (John 15:18–19) and seek to kill them (John 16:2–3). A world that promises them “tribulation” (John 16:33). And here’s something interesting: that word Jesus uses for tribulation in Greek is “thlipsis,” which means pressure or pressing together. Sort of like childbirth. There is no joy quite like seeing your child for the first time. When our son, Noah, made his appearance last Thursday night, I was left breathless. He was healthy, strong, and breathing. My eyes filled with joyful tears. And my wife, whose pain certainly wasn’t finished, was overcome with that same joy as well. The midwife handed her our boy, and she held him close as though she had been handed the most precious thing on earth. Because, of course, she had. All of the difficulties of pregnancy and labor didn’t suddenly disappear, they just had a greater meaning now. They had produced new life. We are so incredibly grateful that our son is healthy and that there were no complications in labor. When we look at him, we are reminded of the good gifts God has given us, none greater than our children. But both Becca and I can’t help but think of our friends who have just said goodbye to their own precious gifts. Our hearts are filled with pain and sorrow alongside them. How can there be such pure, unadulterated joy in this world, and at the same time such heartbreaking, suffocating pain? This world is terrible. And yet it is beautiful. Somehow these two realities co-exist in our lives. For some reason, we have been placed in a story full of both great light and profound darkness. This seems to be very much a part of God’s plan. Maybe this is why, in Isaiah 43, God tells His people that they can find hope in the midst of the darkest of circumstances. “Behold, I am doing a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.”(Isaiah 43:19) And maybe this is why, right after telling his disciples that they were about to experience something like a woman in labor, Jesus pivots to one of my favorite statements in the Gospels. It serves as the conclusion to the preparation Jesus has taken these men through. All the words, all the wisdom, all the warnings. Then he concludes with this: “I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.” (John 16:33) It’s a call-back to what he just said earlier in the chapter. He tells his disciples they will face great pressure, great pain, a sort of labor-like experience. They can count on it. But… it will be worth it. They can “take heart,” because Jesus is greater than the pain of this world. How is it possible to celebrate in the midst of a broken world? How can we be hopeful when everything seems to be getting worse all the time? How can we be at peace when nothing makes sense? There are no easy answers. Jesus doesn’t give his disciples one in John 16. And he doesn’t give us an easy answer either. Instead, he tells us what life will often feel like: childbirth. Painful. Exhausting. A great pressing together. We can expect it. But the pain has a point — it is producing something better. God is making something new, and if we trust in Him, we will see it make its appearance soon enough. I firmly believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel. That the darkness of this world will be turned into light. That our dear friends will see and hold their sweet children again one day soon in heaven. That whatever pain or loss we experience in this life will be redeemed. That there will be rivers in the desert. Jesus has promised it. So for us, we hold on to this hope like we hold on to our newborn son: with eyes open to the heartbreak around us, but with hearts full of joy and hope. God has made something new. God is making something new. And it will be worth it. -- -- Sports. Stories. And the Search for Life. Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "
154,Are You Always Cold?,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Raafeke Follow NutriNatal -- Listen Share You Could Be Pregnant. Hello everyone! In today’s society, the illnesses and ailments we all deal with on a daily basis have become a source of humor and even identity for people of all ages. When it comes to coupling, a trope of the “warm” partner and “cold” partner even exists, especially between men and women. To be more specific, women are usually labelled as anemic at a higher rate than men. This disparity in anemia diagnoses between genders is caused by a host of reasons, such as a higher likelihood of iron deficiencies in women due to menstrual cycles. Did you know, however, that pregnancy can cause anemia as well? A developing fetus can deplete its mother of iron, causing her to become anemic. Most cases of maternal anemia are mild, however, severe instances can increase the likelihood of a premature birth, as well as postpartum infections. Luckily, increasing one’s iron levels is not hard and can be done with the help of supplements if nutrition is not enough. Foods such as meat, lentils, spinach, and nuts are just a few examples of iron rich foods, and if these fail, supplements can be taken to help boost iron levels. As always, speak with your doctor before making dietary changes or taking certain supplements. For more information about pregnancy-related wellness, be sure to follow us here at NutriNatal!

155,I’d Lie to the Pediatrician If It Meant I’d Survive,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Taryn Jarboe Follow Age of Empathy -- 20 Share I thought about skipping my son’s two-year wellness checkup. We’d moved from Maine to Maryland a month before his second birthday. Eagerly, I canceled his prescheduled checkup in Maine via the patient portal. “See ya never!” I said as I slammed the laptop shut and walked away. It was the least traumatizing patient portal visit I’d had in years. Traumatizing pediatric experiences were setting like the sun in the backdrop of my life. With it came a feeling of calm, almost peace, because those Maine pediatrician visits would likely never rise again. It’s not personal to the pediatrics practice. Once, I had considered applying to it after nursing school, but then our eight-month-old daughter June became sick. She was preliminarily diagnosed with cancer in the outpatient clinic, which sat in a building adjacent to where I took my kids for all of their sick and wellness visits. They shared a parking lot. The same lot I had driven June into and parked on the day we were told she might have “CHILDHOOD CANCER.” The two words I could see etched in the air around the pediatrician’s head after she’d spoken them. In order for me to process them, I needed to visualize them. To understand what she had just told me, I had to painfully spell the two words out in my mind. -- -- 20 Age of Empathy Healing with writing after losing my daughter to neuroblastoma.

It wasn’t quite how I envisioned my afternoon, but–as has been true for the past year–he needs my help. I never thought my father would need my help, but at nearly 82, he does. He has outlived my mother, and these past 13 years since her death have given us a chance to connect in ways I never imagined. From my birth, my dad and I enjoyed hanging out together. There are snapshots of me lying on his chest, both of us sound asleep. He recounts how he’d palm my head and my body would rest on his forearm while I’d sleep. As I grew older, he and I would take walks together, me barely able to reach his index finger. When my mother was expecting my brother, my dad and I would go to the park to walk, and then he’d buy me a hotdog, minus the bun, to give her time to herself. He taught us how to ride our bikes, and then, when he was home on the weekends, we’d take long bike rides, just the three of us. It was his way of spending time with us after traveling all week.

157,Confronting Age Dysmorphia,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Randall H. Duckett Follow Crow’s Feet -- 27 Listen Share Question: How do you go from someone who knows everything to someone who knows nothing? Answer: Have kids. Launch them into the world. Grow old. As I age, I’ve found that the one who raised my daughters as an all-knowing parent (I come in second in that category to my wife) has given way to the senior who’s seen by said children and their fellow young adults as clueless. Okay, boomer. Suddenly seniors like me seem to know nothing while younger people know everything. They believe they better understand everything about parenting, politics, and how to eat toast (with avocados). Our lifetime of experience is discounted to mere nostalgia — unimportant, trivial, out-of-date. This phenomenon reminds me of a Peter, Paul & Mary song called “Old Enough (Ode to Aging).” It’s a rock track nestled among mostly folk on their 1995 LifeLines album. The tune includes these lyrics: Just when you’ve got the wisdom of the ages, nobody seems to want to turn your pages. Seniors: Sound familiar? This is one aspect of what I’ve coined as age dysmorphia — the disconnect between how I view myself in my mind and how I’m perceived in the world. Traditionally, dysmorphia has referred to self-image that is incongruent with what people see in the mirror, thus causing difficulties coping with life and sometimes physical harm. Further, explains Thomas Rutledge, Ph.D, in an article for Psychology Today: In the field of mental health, perhaps the most famous example of the difficulty seeing ourselves objectively is a condition called body dysmorphia. Body dysmorphia is diagnosed when a person perceives flaws in their body or appearance to a degree that causes dysfunction or even physical harm. This condition can take many forms: underweight people can perceive themselves as fat, healthy or even well-muscled people can perceive themselves as small or weak, and people of average or even above-average attractiveness can perceive themselves as disgusting or ugly. Importantly, people with body dysmorphia are usually impervious to objective evidence and suffer the profound emotional and physical repercussions of their distorted self-perceptions. Body dysmorphia, however, is just one narrow manifestation of our ability to create dysfunctional self-illusions. Characterizing dysmorphia more broadly as an enduring state of negative emotions and behaviors resulting from misperceptions about the self, for example, dysmorphia possesses faces and forms so numerous as to affect people in every category of age, race, gender, and social strata of our society. Yet few recognize the concept of age dysmorphia. An Internet search for that phrase turns up only one reference, and it’s about women in their 40s trying to stay looking young. That’s not the kind of dysmorphia I’m talking about. My age dysmorphia isn’t about eternal youth — I appreciate aging. But there is a gap between how I see myself in my mind and what I see in the mirror each day. In my mind, I’m eternally 30-something–youngish, handsome, strong, and smart. My face is free of blemishes. My eyes are clear. My hair is full. I am, in my own way, attractive. I move easily, playing racquetball with my boss and mentor, touring European capitals, and completing complex home improvement and repair projects around the house. Internally, I still see myself as a man on top of my game, a great father, a model employee, a caring husband, a sexy beast. Except, now that I am in my 60s, am I not that person anymore? Despite my inner portrait of myself, when I look in the bathroom mirror, my face is marked with wrinkles and dark and light spots. My muscles are loose. My eyes look cloudy. My hair is there (I fortunately have no gray) but it is thinning. Moreover, I have a grumpy resting face that makes me seem as though I’m pissed off at everyone, even though I’m generally not. I try to look cheerful, but my aging smile takes work to muster. In my mind’s eye, I can move freely. In reality, I walk in a way that can only be described as hobbling along. Inside, I am cool like I was decades ago; in reality, I am past my “use by” date. (This just in: My wife reports I was never cool.) My inner self is bursting with the energy to contribute to the world; in reality, I want to lie down and take a nap. For me, age dysmorphia causes cognitive dissonance between the person I see in my mind’s eye and the current me. I am fortunate in that this doesn’t cause many practical problems in my life, but it does shake me when confronted with it. Internally I struggle with reconciling my inner and outer identities. How can I resolve the two and become more “me” as I age? I’m trying to do this by creating then following a handful of strategies to address my age dysmorphia. If you are similarly afflicted, I offer these ideas: In popular culture, age is something you battle. Don’t agree? For evidence, see the untold number of products aimed at making you look and feel younger, from Prevargen to Botox. I’m giving up fighting and am now going for alignment between my internal sense of self and my external place in the world. My age dysmorphia problem is worst when I sit still and obsess about who I am. It’s less prevalent when I’m present with whatever I’m doing, such as reading with my toddler granddaughter or watching TV with my wife. It’s not repressing the dysmorphia; it’s living the life you have today to the fullest. In my head, I have a lifetime of fascinating experiences and harmful trauma to process. I’m trying not to cling to the past and attempt to replay it. I’m concentrating on what I can do now — such as writing essays for Medium or working on a book about the emotions of chronic pain (see bio below) — rather than the things I’ve had to set aside as I’ve aged, like making a hook shot or swimming in the ocean. As I’ve said, I often feel dismissed as irrelevant by my adult children. In doing my writing, I’m creating an identity outside my loved ones. Even though I’m retired from full-time work, I can dream of continuing to contribute my thoughts and perspectives to the world. You can too. I’m working to expand my social circle to include more people my age, by, for example, joining online writers’ groups with other oldsters. Not only can the members understand what I’m going through, but I can listen to and learn from them. All of us have interesting stories to tell about our lives if you just ask. Wait!

After 47 years of running, I find myself slowly jogging into the mists of late life. Old age. Golden years. Whatever you want to call them. My pace slows every year, and my aches and pains increase. But my love, and need, of running is still there. It does not diminish. My best running efforts are long in the past. What I call a run in my 68th year, others most likely consider a glorified shuffle. But I refuse to stop. I will not cease to shuffle simply because I am no longer swift of foot. I will not allow great to become the enemy of good, or in my case mediocre. I am stubborn when it comes to running. For example, I will not run on a treadmill. I run outside. I run in the heat and the cold. Snow. Rain. Wind. I power up hills and float down. No headphones, earbuds or any other artificial noise to mask the wind, the birds, the waves or even the mundane noise of suburbia.

If this interests you please click here for similar content. Active Longevity: Seniors This Space is designed for seniors aged 50 and above who want to stay fit I have never experienced stiffness nor soreness after exercise, and even in my late years still do not. The secret is to maintain at least a base level of fitness and consistently maintain a fitness program. Here are a few tips to keep you in a well-oiled condition, even in your senior years: Maintaining a consistent fitness regime throughout your life is a key factor in avoiding stiffness and soreness, even as you age. As we age, our bodies change, and it’s important to tailor your fitness routine to your current health status. Consulting with a healthcare professional can help you identify any underlying health conditions and recommend exercises that are safe and effective for you. Engaging in low-impact exercises such as walking, swimming, or cycling can be gentle on your joints while still providing cardiovascular benefits. Strength training with resistance bands or light weights is also beneficial for maintaining muscle mass and bone health. Incorporating flexibility exercises like yoga or Pilates can improve balance and reduce the risk of falls. Consistency is crucial for maintaining fitness at any age. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week. Starting with achievable goals and gradually increasing your activity level can help you stay on track. As you age, your body may not respond to exercise the same way it did when you were younger. It’s important to pay attention to the signals your body sends and avoid pushing yourself too hard. Taking appropriate rest days and allowing time for recovery can prevent injuries and ensure long-term sustainability of your fitness routine. Proper nutrition plays a vital role in supporting your fitness efforts. A balanced diet rich in lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, and a variety of fruits and vegetables can provide the necessary nutrients for muscle repair and overall health. Staying hydrated is equally important, especially if you are engaging in regular physical activity. Long-term planning can help you stay committed to your fitness goals. Consider joining community clubs or finding long-term offers at local gyms. Additionally, exploring financial safety nets like over-50 life insurance can provide peace of mind, allowing you to focus on staying healthy and active. Regular movement helps maintain muscle mass, bone density, and joint flexibility. Even simple activities like daily walks can significantly improve your quality of life and help you stay active and fit in your later years. Maintaining a fitness regime throughout your life can help you avoid stiffness and soreness, even as you age. By understanding your health needs, choosing appropriate exercises, following a consistent routine, listening to your body, nourishing yourself properly, planning for the future, and keeping active, you can continue to enjoy the benefits of a healthy and active lifestyle well into your later years. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your fitness routine remains effective and enjoyable, helping you maintain your vitality and well-being as you age.

160,Kids These Days,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Randall H. Duckett Follow Crow’s Feet -- 16 Listen Share The Time magazine cover headline alarms seniors like me: “The Youth Crime Plague.” Inside, the story is dire: People have always accused kids of getting away with murder. Now that is all too literally true. Across the U.S., a pattern of crime has emerged that is both perplexing and appalling. Many youngsters appear to be robbing and raping, maiming and murdering as casually as they go to a movie or join a pickup baseball game. A new, remorseless, mutant juvenile seems to have been born, and there is no more terrifying figure in America today. Frightening to those of us who are older? Of course. An apt reflection of our world in the 2020s? Not so much. A reason to panic? No. The above is an excerpt from a Time cover story published July 11, 1977 — just under half a century ago. Yet it’s easy to mistake that the piece applies to today. I live in the Philly area and the evening news is filled with stories about shootings, stabbings, and vandalism, mostly committed by teens and 20-somethings. The latest crisis is hordes of young people swarming the boardwalks of the Jersey shore. In times like these, we seniors may be tempted to give into fear, to think that the world is going to pot, to utter the classic phrase, “Kids these days.” But the truth is, just as the Time article shows, we’ve all collectively been here before. Most oldsters today grew up in the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s, when youth crime peaked. Others of us rebelled with flower power, Black power, and women’s liberation. Our appalled parents and grandparents believed we were the ones who were driving the world to ruin. With our scary rock ’n’ roll music, long hair on boys, and miniskirts on girls, we terrified them with what appeared to be challenges to the world they had shaped after the Great Depression and World War II. Our folks despaired that we were a lost cause, condemned to live in a worse world than theirs. Most of us, though, turned out to be solid capitalists, parents, and voters. The truth is that every generation thinks the younger ones are out of control. For evidence, go back millennia to the time of Aristotle, who, in the 4th century B.C., complained: [Young people] are high-minded because they have not yet been humbled by life, nor have they experienced the force of circumstances. … They think they know everything, and are always quite sure about it. In 1843, Anthony Ashley Cooper, the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, reported to the English House of Commons about: “… a fearful multitude of untutored savages … [boys] with dogs at their heels and other evidence of dissolute habits … [girls who] drive coal-carts, ride astride upon horses, drink, swear, fight, smoke, whistle, and care for nobody … the morals of children are tenfold worse than formerly.” Fast forward to the ’50s — the 1850s — when Scientific American warned: A pernicious excitement to learn and play chess has spread all over the country, and numerous clubs for practicing this game have been formed in cities and villages … chess is a mere amusement of a very inferior character, which robs the mind of valuable time that might be devoted to nobler acquirements … they require out-door exercises — not this sort of mental gladiatorship. (Thanks to History Hustle for assembling these and other quotes about older generations’ view of younger ones.) The lesson for today’s seniors? As our guru Douglas Adams, author of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, advised, “Don’t panic.” As scary as the world is for us seniors, don’t give in to the idea that America is on an irretrievable path to decline because young people are particularly and irretrievably lawless, don’t want to work hard, or thumb their noses at authority. The fact is, according to an FBI report, for the first three months of this year as compared to the first quarter of 2023: The murder rate fell by 26.4 percent, reported rapes decreased by 25.7 percent, robberies fell by 17.8 percent, aggravated assault fell by 12.5 percent, and the overall violent crime rate went down by 15.2 percent. Despite the alarm coming from the news and politicians who hope to benefit from senior terror in the ratings and at the ballot box, there’s nothing special about the perceived decline in values, ethics, and morals among today’s teens. Each generation of humans thinks its members are special, that nothing like what’s happened to them has happened before. It’s a bias built into us as we grow up and age. It’s a self-centeredness that helps us function but also discounts history. An update of the old adage might go: Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to be scaredy cats. I admit, as I sit here in my 60s, I find myself tempted by hopelessness about the state of the world. I can relate to those who want to reestablish a sense of stability and order. I worry about my toddler grandchildren growing up in an America that’s more Furiosa than Mayberry RFD. But I won’t give in to that fear. I rely on the core values my parents taught me about tolerance, courage, and grace in the face of hard times. I reject the idea that we need to police young people into line or elect authoritarian leaders. I decline to be the kind of senior who grabs a shotgun and growls, “Get off my lawn.” I recognize that what is going on is that we seniors are part of the cycle of history as the old gives way to the young. Just because it’s happening to us, at this particular phase of life, doesn’t make it exceptional. I find solace in knowing these times are not unique. We’ve been here before. And everything mostly worked out fine. Young people grow up. They find relationships, set up homes, and mature to believe in mostly the same things we do — no matter how unlikely that seems to us seniors right now. We are simply a part of the normal cycling of history. The kids will be all right. Eventually, they will turn into us, frightened about what their times’ selfish, entitled, irresponsible, uncaring, uncouth, and disrespectful members of the younger generations are becoming. At least as long as the kids don’t fall into the debauched grasp of chess. Randall H. Duckett is writing a book about the emotions of chronic pain and invites fellow sufferers to share their stories.

165,Kids These Days,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Randall H. Duckett Follow Crow’s Feet -- 16 Listen Share The Time magazine cover headline alarms seniors like me: “The Youth Crime Plague.” Inside, the story is dire: People have always accused kids of getting away with murder. Now that is all too literally true. Across the U.S., a pattern of crime has emerged that is both perplexing and appalling. Many youngsters appear to be robbing and raping, maiming and murdering as casually as they go to a movie or join a pickup baseball game. A new, remorseless, mutant juvenile seems to have been born, and there is no more terrifying figure in America today. Frightening to those of us who are older? Of course. An apt reflection of our world in the 2020s? Not so much. A reason to panic? No. The above is an excerpt from a Time cover story published July 11, 1977 — just under half a century ago. Yet it’s easy to mistake that the piece applies to today. I live in the Philly area and the evening news is filled with stories about shootings, stabbings, and vandalism, mostly committed by teens and 20-somethings. The latest crisis is hordes of young people swarming the boardwalks of the Jersey shore. In times like these, we seniors may be tempted to give into fear, to think that the world is going to pot, to utter the classic phrase, “Kids these days.” But the truth is, just as the Time article shows, we’ve all collectively been here before. Most oldsters today grew up in the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s, when youth crime peaked. Others of us rebelled with flower power, Black power, and women’s liberation. Our appalled parents and grandparents believed we were the ones who were driving the world to ruin. With our scary rock ’n’ roll music, long hair on boys, and miniskirts on girls, we terrified them with what appeared to be challenges to the world they had shaped after the Great Depression and World War II. Our folks despaired that we were a lost cause, condemned to live in a worse world than theirs. Most of us, though, turned out to be solid capitalists, parents, and voters. The truth is that every generation thinks the younger ones are out of control. For evidence, go back millennia to the time of Aristotle, who, in the 4th century B.C., complained: [Young people] are high-minded because they have not yet been humbled by life, nor have they experienced the force of circumstances. … They think they know everything, and are always quite sure about it. In 1843, Anthony Ashley Cooper, the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, reported to the English House of Commons about: “… a fearful multitude of untutored savages … [boys] with dogs at their heels and other evidence of dissolute habits … [girls who] drive coal-carts, ride astride upon horses, drink, swear, fight, smoke, whistle, and care for nobody … the morals of children are tenfold worse than formerly.” Fast forward to the ’50s — the 1850s — when Scientific American warned: A pernicious excitement to learn and play chess has spread all over the country, and numerous clubs for practicing this game have been formed in cities and villages … chess is a mere amusement of a very inferior character, which robs the mind of valuable time that might be devoted to nobler acquirements … they require out-door exercises — not this sort of mental gladiatorship. (Thanks to History Hustle for assembling these and other quotes about older generations’ view of younger ones.) The lesson for today’s seniors? As our guru Douglas Adams, author of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, advised, “Don’t panic.” As scary as the world is for us seniors, don’t give in to the idea that America is on an irretrievable path to decline because young people are particularly and irretrievably lawless, don’t want to work hard, or thumb their noses at authority. The fact is, according to an FBI report, for the first three months of this year as compared to the first quarter of 2023: The murder rate fell by 26.4 percent, reported rapes decreased by 25.7 percent, robberies fell by 17.8 percent, aggravated assault fell by 12.5 percent, and the overall violent crime rate went down by 15.2 percent. Despite the alarm coming from the news and politicians who hope to benefit from senior terror in the ratings and at the ballot box, there’s nothing special about the perceived decline in values, ethics, and morals among today’s teens. Each generation of humans thinks its members are special, that nothing like what’s happened to them has happened before. It’s a bias built into us as we grow up and age. It’s a self-centeredness that helps us function but also discounts history. An update of the old adage might go: Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to be scaredy cats. I admit, as I sit here in my 60s, I find myself tempted by hopelessness about the state of the world. I can relate to those who want to reestablish a sense of stability and order. I worry about my toddler grandchildren growing up in an America that’s more Furiosa than Mayberry RFD. But I won’t give in to that fear. I rely on the core values my parents taught me about tolerance, courage, and grace in the face of hard times. I reject the idea that we need to police young people into line or elect authoritarian leaders. I decline to be the kind of senior who grabs a shotgun and growls, “Get off my lawn.” I recognize that what is going on is that we seniors are part of the cycle of history as the old gives way to the young. Just because it’s happening to us, at this particular phase of life, doesn’t make it exceptional. I find solace in knowing these times are not unique. We’ve been here before. And everything mostly worked out fine. Young people grow up. They find relationships, set up homes, and mature to believe in mostly the same things we do — no matter how unlikely that seems to us seniors right now. We are simply a part of the normal cycling of history. The kids will be all right. Eventually, they will turn into us, frightened about what their times’ selfish, entitled, irresponsible, uncaring, uncouth, and disrespectful members of the younger generations are becoming. At least as long as the kids don’t fall into the debauched grasp of chess. Randall H. Duckett is writing a book about the emotions of chronic pain and invites fellow sufferers to share their stories.

167,Crossfit For The Wrinklies,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Tom Kane Follow Health and  Science -- 1 Listen Share You know what? It’s never too late to begin! I’ve seen people in their 40s, 50s, and even 70s get into CrossFit and absolutely love it. Trust me, CrossFit is for everyone, regardless of age. Now, I’ll be honest with you, as we get older, our bodies change. We might not bounce back as quickly as we used to, and those aches and pains? Well, they become more frequent visitors, but don’t let that discourage you! It just means we need to be a bit smarter about how we approach our fitness journey. When I started CrossFit later in life, I had to shift my focus. It wasn’t about keeping up with the youngsters anymore, it was about improving my quality of life. That’s the real goal here, folks. I’ve learned that good health requires more responsibility as we age. It’s like maintaining a classic car, it needs more TLC to keep running smoothly. Does this mean we need to work out more? Not necessarily. It’s about working out smarter, not harder. 1. Listen to your body. Some days you’ll feel like a superhero, ready to conquer heavy back squats. Other days? Not so much. And that’s okay! 2. Modify exercises when needed. There’s no shame in adapting workouts to suit your body’s needs. 3. Focus on good technique. Trust me, it’s a game-changer. 4. Don’t let fear hold you back. A little discomfort is normal, but know the difference between good pain and bad pain. In CrossFit, we love high-intensity workouts, but remember, intensity is relative. What’s intense for me might be a walk in the park for you, or vice versa. As we age, I’ve found it’s better to work with sub-maximum weights and volume. It keeps the intensity high but the injury risk lower. But here’s the kicker — fitness isn’t just about what we do in the gym. It’s about our lifestyle as a whole. I’ve had to make some changes outside the gym too: 1. Stay active throughout the day. Take walks, ride a bike, do some gardening. Just keep moving! 2. Pay attention to nutrition. Our bodies can’t handle nutritional stress like they used to. I’ve found eating lean proteins, lots of veggies, and minimizing sugar and alcohol works wonders. 3. Prioritize sleep. I try to go to bed at the same time every night and aim for at least 8 hours. It makes a huge difference in recovery. Remember, CrossFit is about more than just physical fitness. It’s about building a community, challenging yourself, and improving your overall quality of life. So, can you start CrossFit at an older age? Absolutely! Just remember to listen to your body, train smart, eat well, and get enough rest. Don’t let age be a barrier. I didn’t, and it’s been one of the best decisions of my life. So why not give it a try? Who knows, you might just surprise yourself with what you’re capable of. After all, we’re all in this together, regardless of age. See you at the box!

Unfortunately, there are some things in life that won’t get better with the passage of time. Chronic illnesses, terminal diseases and permanent disabilities are some of the conditions that will not improve regardless of how much time has passed. When we say that time heals everything, essentially this implies that our happiness is put on hold until our situation improves. What if it doesn’t? What if it worsens instead? Are we then forced to live in a state of unhappiness indefinitely? We would live in misery, waiting for the day that we are completely healed (by time), but unfortunately that day may never arrive. It is good to hope for a better future, but we should also be realistic about it. For me, when something bad happens, I don’t necessarily believe that time will heal.

His magnum opus, The Wealth of Nations, was first published in 1776. In this groundbreaking work, Smith explored the nature and causes of wealth in nations. He addressed topics such as the division of labor, productivity, and free markets. The book laid the foundation for classical economics and influenced subsequent thinkers, economists, and policymakers. Smith’s ideas continue to shape economic thought to this day. According to classical economists like Adam Smith, individuals acting in their self-interest contribute to the overall prosperity of society. Smith famously wrote in The Wealth of Nations that when people pursue their own interests, they unintentionally promote the public good through the invisible hand of the market. This idea underscores the importance of individual motivations in economic decision-making. “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest.

According to Jonathan Pontell, who named this sub-generation, “Jonesers” absorbed a powerful sense of idealism in the optimistic 1960s. But as we came of age in the pessimistic ‘70s and ‘80s, our moods morphed into an unrequited craving — a “Jonesing,” as he called it. This craving presents differently for everyone. Mine lay dormant while I was busy building my career. But when I hit retirement, it crept in — just as Pontell had predicted. Every generation is affected by the headlines of its formative years.

Without getting into that discussion, it reminded me of an unexpected bright spot that came to me with age: mentoring. Although being a mentor isn’t solely determined by an older age, it’s often a responsibility for the more senior and experienced types, especially as they approach the end of their careers.

185,65 is Coming in Hot!,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Annette Henn Follow -- Listen Share I’m a couple weeks from turning age 65 and I vacillate from being incredulous to feeling like, so what? It’s just a number. I am still healthy. I work part time and have some money saved to retire so I can stop working if I feel like it. I know I’m one of the lucky ones. But I don’t want to stop yet; I like my work. I’m an oncology infusion nurse — I give chemotherapy. It provides a way to give back and creates some structure in my life. It challenges me mentally, but it also feeds my soul. I love my patients and working with my much younger co-workers. My work also keeps me grounded and grateful most of the time. I don’t think of myself as old because I’m not (I tell myself) but I do see changes in my looks. I still weigh the same as I did 10 years ago but things have shifted. The skin on my body has slackened here and there. I see crepey skin on my upper arms and neck. I have deep lines my forehead. My lipstick bleeds a little into the lines by my mouth like the old ladies I used to feel sorry for. But now, it’s me. I could probably fix it to some extent, but I just can’t pull the trigger. It would probably help me to get rid of my 10x magnifying mirror, but then I would have difficulty seeing my eyebrows to pluck them. It’s a double-edged sword. I’m single — wasn’t planning on this when I plotted my life years ago. I thought I would be one of the stable ones — long marriage, by now enjoying grandchildren and traveling with my husband like many of my friends. But it didn’t turn out that way. My marriage imploded 10 years ago, a month before my 25th anniversary. It was a very difficult time and adjustment. I’m proud of how I rebalanced myself and revived my old nursing career. Last year, I bought my first house and started a new job in a new area. A crazy leap but I am so grateful I did it. I love my neighborhood and community. Sometimes I sit in my front room on my new sofa (because it will be my last sofa, so it had better be a good one) and I am just in awe. I trusted my intuition, took a leap and feel so grateful. I did have a couple of romances during these last 10 years. I think they were lovely and necessary for a couple reasons. It was nice to be a grown up with a whole different perspective and connect with someone. We weren’t looking to raise a family. We each had our own resources. It was shocking at this “grown up” age to still have these “teenagery” fluttering feelings of excitement and desire. And it was divine to be desired. To have someone tell you that you were funny and smart. But in the end, they didn’t work out. Two years ago, after the last one ended there was a shift in me. The desire to partner, or the expectation that I “should” partner (letting down my girlfriends who enjoyed my regaling them with Match.com stories of strange meetings — and I have some doozies) has calmed for the most part. But I admit, no one is knocking at my door, so I really don’t have a choice. In the two years since then I have traveled extensively, buried both my parents and sold my childhood home. I guess I have been busy — but not running away from myself. I think it is more like, experiencing myself, believing in myself, trusting my inner voice and allowing the Universe to have its way with me. I must also admit however, that even though I try to keep my mind in a place of calm and gratitude, occasionally, when I look in the mirror, the reflection rather shocks me. I must now make little adjustments like, making sure things aren’t in my teeth after eating because of the crevices from my receding gums — this, despite my best efforts at dental hygiene. My 32-year-old female dentist pointed this out during one of my recent visits. “Haven’t you heard the saying ‘Long in the tooth?” I replied to her comment. She giggled and said she had never heard this phrase. I didn’t even try to explain because, putting myself in her place, I don’t know that I would care to hear what I have to say. To her, my age seems so far away. To me, her age and vantage point feels like yesterday. There must be something from the impending 65 that causes the cliches to increase exponentially. A few weeks ago I visited another healthcare provider who gave me a comprehensive exam and among many recommendations, suggested I find a functional medicine doctor. She gave me a list of referral docs. “Which would you suggest?” I asked as I looked at the list. She hesitated. “They are all great” she replied. “Who do you use?” I asked. “Well, Sarah, but she’s pretty young and I’m not sure how she would be with the elderly.” Elderly. Elderly? I looked behind me like Robert DeNiro in “Taxi Driver.” Elderly — screw you elderly (I will admit I had another word typed here). I know I’m a little rough around the edges these days but 2 years ago someone was telling me I was hot (granted, he was 8 years older than me). This bullshit comment bothered me on a deep level. I got home and googled elderly. Sure enough, 65. But it’s like, “young elderly”. Yeah, that makes me feel better. Last week I was in a resort town with my dear friend who is 56. We were having a girls overnight catch-up. We stopped to listen to some music on that beautiful summer evening at a vintage hotel in the small city where we were saying. We noticed this man in green (we called him the leprechaun because he was short, wore a green vest and pants), walking around and chatting up the various groups listening to the music. Eventually he made his way over to us. “Hey, are you girls here for the weekend?” he asked. “No,” my friend said cheerfully, “just here for one night.” “Oh, doing a mom daughter thing?” Silence. My eyes now totally averted (or did I give him the stink eye — I was in too much shock to recall). Regardless, he continued to blather, somehow sensing he had fallen into an abyss. He went on to Plan B— “Oh, a girl’s night.” But it fell on deaf ears as far as I was concerned. I had been pegged as my friend’s mother which meant, at least in chronological years, that I gave birth at the precocious age of 8. I felt my ears ringing — it was literally an out of body experience! My friend and I walked back to our hotel with the sunset and cicadas (in Illinois we are experiencing cicada apocalypse). Being the lovely friend she is, she talked about her younger friend in her 40’s that she gets mistaken for as her mother all the time. Now that’s a true friend, making up a story to help you feel better. Meanwhile, I focused on making my Medicare elections, sifting through the piles of information. For the last six months I had been receiving mailings and calls, listening to podcasts and researching. I finally pulled the trigger and made my choices. One day, my Medicare card arrived in the mail. I snapped a picture of it and texted it to my younger sister with the comment: “I am officially old.” The next workday, I had a patient who shared the same upcoming birthday as mine, except he was 9 years younger. Being my patient, it’s sometimes not the best omen. He had stage 4 cancer but you would never know it by looking at him. He was a little thin but did not look sick. He shared that his youngest daughter had just graduated high school and was planning to become a nurse. We chatted about birthdays and I don’t know what happened to me, but I completely spaced (early dementia?) who I was talking to. “You just wait,” I remarked, inwardly feeling this kinship with our mutual birthdays but momentarily not even considering our hugely divergent circumstances, “once all the Medicare stuff starts coming in the mail and the phone calls. All the choices — it’s overwhelming.” He paused. “I hope I’m here for that,” he said quietly. Sometimes the Universe slaps me upside the head and says, “Snap out of it!” Thank you, my dear patient. Thank you for that nugget of reality. I hope my stupid comment ricocheted out of your mind as soon as I said it. I could torture myself for that thoughtless moment, but I’m so sick of beating myself up. Instead, I say thank you for the reminder to have gratitude for the mundane, because there are literally those around you who would give anything for that experience. To experience crow’s feet and wrinkles. To be overwhelmed with Medicare choices. To be single and have lots of choices. To be alive and laugh at being called your friend’s mom.

Every day, more than 11,000 Americans turn 65 — part of the massive group of 71.6 million Baby Boomers born in the years following World War II. I’ve always considered myself a Boomer. But as a late one, born between 1957 and 1964, I learned that I belong to a tagalong cohort called Generation Jones. According to Jonathan Pontell, who named this sub-generation, “Jonesers” absorbed a powerful sense of idealism in the optimistic 1960s. But as we came of age in the pessimistic ‘70s and ‘80s, our moods morphed into an unrequited craving — a “Jonesing,” as he called it. This craving presents differently for everyone. Mine lay dormant while I was busy building my career. But when I hit retirement, it crept in — just as Pontell had predicted. Every generation is affected by the headlines of its formative years. To better understand what brought me to this niggling place of dissatisfaction, I decided to look back at the major milestones of my life. -- -- 43 Crow’s Feet Health writer and essayist offering insights into physical and emotional wellness and successful aging.

While this might sound obvious, it needed to be said. Good nutrition feeds the mind and body not just for daily surviving but for long-term thriving. Poor nutrition — the typical Western diet heavy in red meat, sugar and highly processed food that’s barely food — eats away at blood, bones, brain and other organs, day by day, down at the cellular level, in ways we can’t feel or see until, kaboom, we have cancer, or type 2 diabetes, or dementia, or or or … I could go on and on, right up to and including premature death.

195,The Covid-19 SAGA from the Bharatiya Prospective.,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in akashwaninow Follow -- Listen Share India is pretty isolated from China via Himalayas physically and by Chinese firewall virtually. News about China arrives via western media into India. But the first ever covid-19 case, it was called novel coronavirus back then, arrived directly from People’s Republic. Student returning from China in January 2020 brought this exotic oriental decease to India. The game was on. Fear spread in the society was clearly visible in low travel, reduced outing, empty cinema halls etc. Even Railway and Air Line authorities were issuing advisories to discourage travel. While continuing with the fear Psy-op 24 by 7, sporadically India bashing was also added to the mix. The Hindu went as far as to call Covid as Indian Virus. While India prepared for the battle with first wave of covid. PM Modi gave call for Janata Curfew. And subsequently total lock down on 24th march 2020. Also Rohingyas were captured from Bihar. Any one remember Tablighi Jamat and it’s maulana Saad? The game proceeded to the next stage. It was supposed to ran on two wheels. Death and Vaccination. Both were supposed to run side by side. It was similar to Operation Lockstep of Rockefeller Foundation mentioned in their Annual Report of 2010, a decade ago. Death was to be provided by India and vaccine by the west. Soon India bashing moved to another level. The entire Indian population was wiped out of existence in fancy articles of western expert’s wet dreams. But India held on and moved forward as much as it could. India’s approach was three prone. First was sound fiscal policy. Indian government paid interest on late payment for all borrowers for amount below Rs. 25.00 Lakhs (US$ 33,157/-). That not only helped poor but also banks. Today in 2024 India is the only reliable economy with strong balance sheets for the banks. Second was providing free ration to poor. So they wont starve to death. This took out the one wheel of death from the plan. Third was the home-made vaccine. Very early the media was promoting about vaccine. No one was asking for medicine. They say only vaccine could save us. First vaccine was from Pfizer. But it was from Astra-Zeneca which complicated things. Astra-Zeneca vaccine was researched at an Oxford lab to which heavy donation was received from Indian Businessman Mr. Cyrus Poonawalla. Oxford was bound by an agreement to share research with Serum Institute of India. The first person who stepped out in the open was Bill Gates. He openly and clearly sated his position that vaccine formula should not be shared with India. But Oxford unlike for any britisher lived upto the contract and did share the formula with Serum Institute of India. It was based on Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API), or input in layman’s term, which are produced in United States. So obviously next step was to prevent India from accessing raw material input for the vaccine. Only after much deliberation US President Joe Biden lifted his export ban to India. But it was not over. The Indian vaccine deemed to be sub-par and vaccinated persons were denied entry into UK. But the problem was never the Covi-Shield made from Oxford Formula. The real problem came from Co-vaccine Indian formula, Indian Manufacturing and Indian export. There was nothing west could do about it. And India exported it’s vaccines to 96 countries under Vaccine Maitri. India broke the second wheel of Vaccine export as well. So something had to be done. During the second wave attempt were made to make up the lost ground on deaths and also halt the vaccine exports. That wave could have run for week and India would have been pushed into lock down again. All politicians started openly lobbying for Pfizer vaccine.

200,The Covid-19 SAGA from the Bharatiya Prospective.,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in akashwaninow Follow -- Listen Share India is pretty isolated from China via Himalayas physically and by Chinese firewall virtually. News about China arrives via western media into India. But the first ever covid-19 case, it was called novel coronavirus back then, arrived directly from People’s Republic. Student returning from China in January 2020 brought this exotic oriental decease to India. The game was on. Fear spread in the society was clearly visible in low travel, reduced outing, empty cinema halls etc. Even Railway and Air Line authorities were issuing advisories to discourage travel. While continuing with the fear Psy-op 24 by 7, sporadically India bashing was also added to the mix. The Hindu went as far as to call Covid as Indian Virus. While India prepared for the battle with first wave of covid. PM Modi gave call for Janata Curfew. And subsequently total lock down on 24th march 2020. Also Rohingyas were captured from Bihar. Any one remember Tablighi Jamat and it’s maulana Saad? The game proceeded to the next stage. It was supposed to ran on two wheels. Death and Vaccination. Both were supposed to run side by side. It was similar to Operation Lockstep of Rockefeller Foundation mentioned in their Annual Report of 2010, a decade ago. Death was to be provided by India and vaccine by the west. Soon India bashing moved to another level. The entire Indian population was wiped out of existence in fancy articles of western expert’s wet dreams. But India held on and moved forward as much as it could. India’s approach was three prone. First was sound fiscal policy. Indian government paid interest on late payment for all borrowers for amount below Rs. 25.00 Lakhs (US$ 33,157/-). That not only helped poor but also banks. Today in 2024 India is the only reliable economy with strong balance sheets for the banks. Second was providing free ration to poor. So they wont starve to death. This took out the one wheel of death from the plan. Third was the home-made vaccine. Very early the media was promoting about vaccine. No one was asking for medicine. They say only vaccine could save us. First vaccine was from Pfizer. But it was from Astra-Zeneca which complicated things. Astra-Zeneca vaccine was researched at an Oxford lab to which heavy donation was received from Indian Businessman Mr. Cyrus Poonawalla. Oxford was bound by an agreement to share research with Serum Institute of India. The first person who stepped out in the open was Bill Gates. He openly and clearly sated his position that vaccine formula should not be shared with India. But Oxford unlike for any britisher lived upto the contract and did share the formula with Serum Institute of India. It was based on Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API), or input in layman’s term, which are produced in United States. So obviously next step was to prevent India from accessing raw material input for the vaccine. Only after much deliberation US President Joe Biden lifted his export ban to India. But it was not over. The Indian vaccine deemed to be sub-par and vaccinated persons were denied entry into UK. But the problem was never the Covi-Shield made from Oxford Formula. The real problem came from Co-vaccine Indian formula, Indian Manufacturing and Indian export. There was nothing west could do about it. And India exported it’s vaccines to 96 countries under Vaccine Maitri. India broke the second wheel of Vaccine export as well. So something had to be done. During the second wave attempt were made to make up the lost ground on deaths and also halt the vaccine exports. That wave could have run for week and India would have been pushed into lock down again. All politicians started openly lobbying for Pfizer vaccine. Poster were put with question to PM Modi as to why vaccine of our children were exported? But India did something nobody eve uttered a word about. Vaccine was never Modi’s Primary focus.

205,We Finally Know What Drives Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (and Long-Covid),"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Shin Jie Yong, MSc (Res) Follow Microbial Instincts -- 105 Share In 1955, an outbreak of encephalomyelitis struck the Royal Free Hospital Group in London, U.K., hospitalizing over 200 patients. Encephalomyelitis is the inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, typically caused by infections. But what’s intriguing is that about 2% of the patients developed what is known today as myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), which is also a subtype of long-Covid. This incident was published in the British Medical Journal in 1957, which is likely the earliest record of ME/CFS. But the subsequent decades were met with widespread skepticism about this condition. A few experts even believed ME/CFS is psychosocial, a hysteria of some sort. As a result, the amount of research done on ME/CFS was pitiful. Getting funding to do research on ME/CFS was notoriously hard as well. Today, we’re paying the price. The pathomechanisms (patho- means disease) of ME/CFS — as well as its risk factors, prognosis, and treatments — remain poorly understood. We have bits of studies covering different pathomechanisms of ME/CFS but none were unifying and convincing. -- -- 105 Microbial Instincts Independent science writer and researcher | Named Standford's world top 1% scientists | Medium's boost nominator | Elite Powerlifter | Ghostwriter | Malaysian Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "
206,Visualizing Coronavirus Tweets with Dash: Insights and Trends,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Moaz Haroon Follow -- Listen Share In the age of social media, platforms like Twitter provide a real-time glimpse into public sentiment and behavior. With the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic, millions of tweets have been generated discussing various aspects of this global event. To make sense of this vast data, we’ve developed a dashboard using Dash, a Python framework for building analytical web applications. Our dashboard leverages several powerful technologies to process and visualize the data: Our dashboard connects to a PostgreSQL database and presents several visualizations to help understand the trends and insights from the tweets. This line chart, created using Plotly, displays the daily count of tweets. It highlights the volume of discussions and how it fluctuates over time. Spikes in the graph may correspond to significant events or announcements related to the pandemic. The cumulative line chart shows the total number of tweets accumulated over time. This visualization provides a clear picture of the growing conversation volume and can help identify the periods of increased activity. Sentiment analysis categorizes tweets into different sentiments, such as positive, negative, and neutral. The histogram reveals the distribution of these sentiments, giving us an idea of the overall mood of the public regarding the pandemic. This bar chart ranks the top 10 locations by the number of tweets. It helps identify where most of the discussions are originating from, offering insights into regional engagement levels. Hashtags are a powerful way to track trending topics. The bar chart of the top 10 hashtags shows the most frequently used hashtags, indicating the key themes and discussions in the tweets. Tracking the top 60 hashtags over time with a line chart provides insights into the evolution of trending topics. It helps us understand how different issues have gained or lost attention over the course of the pandemic. Our Dash dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for visualizing and analyzing tweets related to the Coronavirus. By examining daily tweet counts, sentiment distribution, top locations, and trending hashtags, we can gain valuable insights into public opinion and behavior during this unprecedented time. The combination of Dash and Plotly allows for the creation of highly interactive and visually appealing charts, making data exploration intuitive and engaging. Pandas provides robust data manipulation capabilities, while PostgreSQL ensures efficient data storage and retrieval. Whether you are a researcher, data scientist, or just curious about social media trends, this dashboard offers a detailed view of the digital discourse surrounding the pandemic. Feel free to clone the GitHub repository and explore the data on your own.

207,“Do You Know What Today Is?”: Long Grief and the Experience of Living in a Post-Pandemic World,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Faithe J Day Follow -- 6 Share As someone who lives with numerous mysterious ailments, I am generally tapped into the world of wellness and self-help. One of the things that has significantly helped me on my journey toward healing is being mindful of and acknowledging trauma anniversaries. If you’re unfamiliar with the concept, the body sometimes retains the dates of traumatic events, even if the mind does not. That’s why keeping track of trauma or grief anniversaries can be an excellent way to manage your mental health and take care of yourself during challenging times. And while I thought I knew all my anniversaries, I discovered a new one this week. While scrolling through TikTok, I came across a video from Dr. Joy, a well-known psychologist who hosts the podcast and platform “Therapy for Black Girls.” She informed us that we were experiencing a societal grief anniversary largely unrecognized within popular culture. This week, four years ago, marks the beginning of the period of social isolation that followed the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic in America. Reflecting on this anniversary, Dr. Joy emphasized the importance of self-care and recognizing signs of grief. -- -- 6 Writer, Creator, and Educator. Millennial and Internet Expert.

208,Reluctantly Maturing Gen Xer,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Darya Mead Follow -- Listen Share Attempting to Age Well in a Fraying America 1965 — the year I was born — the first combat troops were sent to Vietnam, Malcom X was assassinated and the Sound of Music was the top grossing film. It was a long time ago. I’m actually on the cusp of the Baby Boomer era, but consider myself a Gen X-er in every way. So as I move towards my 59th birthday — and my first born turns 25 — I have been reflecting on aging, my family legacy and my own relationship to the whole darn process. Having just recovered from my first bout of Covid — which my Dr. friend said was mild, and given the debate about Biden’s fitness for candidacy — I have been musing a bit more than usual on health, wellness and youthful vigor. In a weird way, finally getting Covid — after multiple exposures and relentless vigilance, where I had finally loosened a bit — was sort of a relief. To finally succumb to the strain that has been dubbed ‘The Kraken’ was humbling, weird, non linear and vexing, but also gave me a more nuanced perspective on the whole chaotic pandemic mess and how so many have suffered. A whisper of fragility — some PTSD from a bout of mono in my 20’s — and the long tail of recovery, makes you think and be grateful for health. More than a month out from testing positive, I feel pretty much back to normal, except I swam laps today and have lost stamina. A recent hike was challenging; or at least felt more so than before The Kraken. I’ll take it, a little unproductive cough, some odd larynx inflammation and a little less energy. All in all, my general fitness and health, vaccination and boosts, and my ‘luxury’ in being able to stay home/ work from home helped a lot, along with some acupuncture, gentle yoga, good nourishing food and lots of rest. Unfortunately this is not a comfort everyone enjoys in America, where now, friends are headed back to work after 5 days and told to just wear a mask. Since I had Covid, I’ve had 3 encounters that have really shaken or shifted my perspective on aging well. The first involved a Lyft driver in Seattle, I’ll call Miranda. A single mom of 5 kids, I only learned she was in her mid-forties at the end of a ride that involved some pretty deep conversation about race, politics, poverty, obesity and health. I had assumed she was about my age. As an aside, I don’t use Uber/ Lyft that often if I can help it, but I would say besides new immigrants, most of my drivers have been single moms; so that tells you a lot about the American economy. Yeah it’s an OK gig for a mom, you can make your own schedule etc., but everyone I talk to says they don’t make enough money. Although, Miranda said she was applying to ferry foster kids to supervised parental visits; a supposedly lucrative offshoot with an understandably onerous application process. A savvy white woman with bi-racial kids, she was hoping to get a gastric bypass to help her lose weight and stay alive and healthy for her kids. We talked about movement and how she has spots she gets out of the car and does circuits. I heard about one bright, motivated daughter who wants to go to med-school and encouraged her to support her in applying to some top schools where she might get a great aid package. UW — where both my kids are studying — is a top school for pre-med, so we talked about that too. She also told me about two friends, one who went blind because of her out of control diabetes, and another who has had terribly long Covid. Anyway, the more than an hour long ride bore many profound tangents. I wished her well and gave her a phat tip. The second interaction was at a QFC; a Safeway-like supermarket in Sequim Washington. I stopped in to buy strawberries and asparagus and a bottle of white wine. I was visiting my 91 year old mother-in-law who has volunteer rhubarb in her backyard. I usually visit in August /September, but this year it was early July and the copious blackberry bushes were just flowering. Normally I make blackberry jam, and last year I made blackberry rhubarb jam which was extra yummy, tart, sweet, tangy, with not too many seeds. They get stuck in my teeth and create havoc all day if I have no access to dental floss; yet another random aging issue. So… at checkout, a very hardscrabble looking woman carded me. I joked that I was old, and showed her my driver’s license. She hesitated, crumpled her face and looked at me and said she was 8 years younger than me and I looked great. Note to self, don’t say you’re old, when confronted with someone who has seemingly lived a hard life… but stay tuned for interaction #3. We giggled together, had a moment, and I left wondering what her life was like. Certainly she had smoked, but what situation — beyond unfortunate genetics — leads a woman to look 70 at age 50? I will say, if a woman has a few extra pounds and is moderately fit, I think it is a more youthful look than the obsessively thin look Hollywood would have us assume is desired, but maybe I’m just making excuses, because the struggle is real. I do know, shitty healthcare, an economy that punishes women and possible addiction are devastating psychically and physically. Both she and Miranda (who admitted making poor choices in men) sadly are not alone. Struggling to raise kids alone and earn a living, fighting many nefarious forces internal and external, is exhausting, unhealthy and saps vitality. I thought about her as I stirred my bubbling jam later that night. Cut to a public swimming pool right outside San Francisco for interaction number three on my aging revelation tour. I swim — or try to — twice a week. I do about 20–30 laps and have an entire dorky routine with flippers, ear plugs and a kickboard. I have been doing the same routine for 35 years. I always think of my dad who died in 2018. He did his outdated Canadian Air Force exercises until about age 80; the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. He also had a hard time with aging and looked quite young until he had a triple bypass at age 76. My mom is now 86 and looks great. So I guess genetics are somewhat on my side. Both my parents were social workers and deeply empathic people, but both prone to occasional vanity. I am beginning to truly understand that inheritance, yet still not ready to stop dyeing my hair; as good as my silver haired sisters look. It was my first time back doing laps post Covid. I swim any chance I get, but the actual laps are another beast. There was a new ‘green’ lifeguard for summer running the desk. He seemed younger than my kids and a bit floppy and unsure. There were issues with the computer, so when I finally paid, he quoted me $9. I said: “I’m a senior.” I had realized a few months ago — finally seeing the entrance fees posted up — that the senior rate starts at age 55. This made my day when I discovered the senior discount was $6, and am hell bent to take advantage of it. He looked at me with his puppy dog eyes and apologized and said: “sorry, but you look so young.” We laughed and I offered to show him my license, but he said it was OK. I had a great swim, albeit with a bit less stamina… onwards. It’s hard not to fret daily on the micro and macro level. I just got a call from my mechanic and my 11 year-old car needs new brakes and a radiator and other stuff; price tag $1932. How can one ever get ahead? So many — particularly women — are one check engine light away from hunger, unemployment and/ or homelessness. There has to be a better way to live, age and thrive, and to take better care of ourselves, our children, our aging parents, our community and the planet. I’m feeling a bit ostrich-y of late regarding many current events and trying to focus on the positive things I can do for myself and others. I don’t know what will happen with the election, Gaza, Reproductive Rights, Climate Change and any litany of potential disasters. I’m just trying to be present, active, aware of others’ challenges and move through my days with grace and humor. Writing, moving my body, doing good work and laughing helps me synergize and keep it as much together as I can. -- -- Writer, Producer, Media Manager and Mom in San Francisco, Darya writes about travel, parenting, food and health and wellness for TV, print, and online outlets.

210,Following Winston Churchill’s routine for a day,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Bill Bowkett Follow -- 2 Listen Share Slumped on my study at zero hours, struggling to finish what remained in the bottle of whisky I had been consuming all day, drunkard me came across all British. Not because I was intoxicated — this does evoke a weird feeling of patriotism — but because I had just gone a full day emulating one of history’s greatest statesmen. Some of you may be reading this thinking, ‘so what?’ Winston Churchill lived a lavish lifestyle, smoking as many as ten cigars a day. He also had a team of servants in Chartwell, his countryside home in Kent. On the face of it, it is hard to see how Winston’s indulgent customs have any resonance — or relevance — to today’s world, especially during the coronavirus crisis. But there is more to Churchill’s well documented routine — which he established around the 1930s — than metrics of Johnnie Walker and Pol Roger. Richard Langworth, a biographer of the former PM, told me that Churchill’s work ethic — built through his rigid routine — was key to his successes. “It certainly was critical in his output. It made a huge difference.” He added that Churchill’s schedule was made even more remarkable by the fact that he would adjust his schedule so that he could travel hundreds of miles to speak at gatherings, sometimes in front of thousands of people. 7.30 — Wake up, remain in bed, eat breakfast, read newspapers, work, glass of whiskey and soda. 11:00 — Out of bed, stroll around garden supervising estate, whiskey and soda. 13:00 — Multi-course lunch, imperial pint of Champagne. 15:30 — Work from study, glass of cognac. 17:00 — Hour and a half nap/siesta, a habit acquired during his time in Cuba. 18:30 — Wake up, bath, dress for dinner. 20:00 — Lengthly dinner with guests, imperial pint of Champagne. 00:00 — Work in study, more cognac. 01:00–03:00 — Bedtime. I wanted to find out what — if anything — can be taken from his approach, especially as during lockdown many of us have found it very challenging working from home. I therefore set myself the challenge of sticking to Churchill’s dictatorial routine for 24-hours and realised his routine is not as ridiculous as you think. Day began in bed. Normally at this time, around 7 am, I would be up preparing myself for the day ahead. But, on this occasion, I am enjoying breakfast in my PJs. Many believe that bed should be reserved for dreaming, not for working as a sort of makeshift office. One such expert, Dr Sophie Bostock, says it is bad for posture and disrupts sleep. However, Langworth notes, Churchill was “highly productive in bed”, often reading all the newspapers and getting work done. I must say though that as a rare occasion, there is no harm in doing this. Focusing in my bedroom offered solitude as the sun beamed through the windows, an oasis far from distractions. At around 10am, my mother opened the door and chucked the newest edition of The Spectator at me. “Good morning, Winston,” she murmured, unimpressed with the beverage accompanying my poached egg and jam (one of Winston’s favourites). It was a diluted whiskey with sparkling water — or “papa cocktail” mouthwash, as Churchill’s daughter put it. Drinking flooded a sense of foreboding for the rest of the day. On that morning, I gave a class presentation on Scottish independence (how convenient then that I was consuming Scotch). I had told my assessment group what I was doing, who guffawed at my plan. And as I turned on my webinar screen, I noticed that my tutor was bemused at choice of duvet setting. Still, at least from my Zoom window, it looked like I was sipping water. After class, I made my way to the garden. Churchill would survey his estate for intruders and take a breather. After hours of drudgery, a stroll around my garden — gazing at the sky as blue as hibiscus and listening to the chirps of collared doves — lifted my spirits. “Boris was condemned for taking naps at No 10. There is no need to feel shamed for indulging in daytime breaks” Afternoon was a less ideal affair. Firstly, my sister popped by downstairs with a stern look to tell me I was “disgusting”. Now was time for an expansive lunch and a whole bottle of Champagne. Unsurprisingly, the worst pandemic in a century has driven many Britons to drink with retail sales of alcohol up during self-isolation. Never did I expect it would be doing it to emulate my hero. I staggered through my meal and copped my stepsister in awe. “That is so much! How can you even do that?” Pushed to the edge, I staggered to bed for my siesta — a short afternoon nap Churchill made a habit of his after reporting as a journalist in Cuba. The thinking behind the siesta is explained in an old letter Churchill wrote to his nephew: “Don’t think you will be doing less work because you sleep during the day. That’s a foolish notion held by people who have no imagination. You will be able to accomplish more.” When Boris Johnson was revealed to be taking naps at No 10, many condemned him for his actions. But there is no need to feel shamed for indulging in daytime breaks. In fact, the Sleep Foundation say that naps can boost short-term alertness as well as ease stress. After a few hours of kip, I sprung up reenergised. The key is to not to rest for more time than is required, otherwise you will come out groggy. Several units in, it was hard to tell whether I was or not. Nevertheless, I undressed and plunged into a hot bath. Sadly, I do not have a butler to scrub my backside like Churchill had, but soaking myself is a soothing tub was the perfect antidote to my day, acting as a bubbly cocoon for relaxation. The Harvard Women’s Health Watch says the benefits of baths are more than skin deep. Among its benefits, baths regularly help ease muscle pain, ease certain types of chronic pain and potentially improve heart health. Then there are the mental health effects. It is said that baths were extremely important in aiding Churchill’s wellbeing. Even though I was now clean and calmed, I felt queasy and started seeing two of everything. It did not help that I still had another pint of bubbly and brandy to go. I digressed, kept calm and carried on and sat downstairs for dinner. No friends or comrades to sit alongside (we are living in a pandemic, Winston!) so I called my friends on the phone where we held conversation virtually all throughout the night. My family, however, started to take note of my inebriated behaviour. “Are you alright?” My mother asked. “Yuh, I’m ph..fine.” Fearful of further embarrassment, I made my way back upstairs. At this point, Churchill would be on the brandy, but thus came my eventual downfall. It was now midnight, and for Churchill he would have just finished dinner with guests and was now ready to work all through the late night. “He would write past bedtime for most people, often till 3 am. Reinvigorated by his afternoon nap,” said Langworth. “Churchill would be on the brandy, but thus came my eventual downfall” Everything I had done to this point had led me to this moment. I was keen to immerse myself in further work, but to no avail. I managed to spill drink all over my cream jumper and write a pitiful 200 words of the article you are reading now. Andrew Roberts, another historian of Churchill’s, told me before I tried this: “I’d set by a day to recover as well as the day of being WSC.” With this in mind, I chose to call it a day knowing the consequences of the next morning. Solely based on how I was feeling several hours later, I would not recommend Churchill’s routine. But hangovers aside, I came to the conclusion that Churchill’s routine made perfect sense. Sure, I do not advocate alcoholism by any stretch of the matter, but Cole Felix, a PhD student who studied Churchill, says his routine reveals an essential principle for success: knowing how to “get things done”, whatever the setting. “It’s tempting to say that he works hard when he is working and plays hard when he is playing. But that would be to miscategorise the nature of his work.” As unorthodox as it may be, Churchill’s routine allowed him to achieve a great deal during the latter — and most important years — of his life. We can learn a thing or two from his daily routines amid the stresses of the coronavirus crisis, like taking leisure and relaxation time into consideration, as well as making a routine that you want to follow rather than one you have to follow. Perhaps by looking at a unique — and special — individual like Churchill, a well thorough routine may be the key to help accomplish the goals we strive to achieve (and never surrender). -- -- 2 Political journalist and ink slinger Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "
211,The Chronicles of a Broken Marriage — Part III,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Lexy G Follow -- Listen Share Pause. I’m pressing pause for a while to zoom out and look at the bigger context in which my personal drama is unfolding. It’s really not all fucking hot guys in mirrors and fingering in the forest. There’s Covid, there’s new motherhood and there’s work. How to keep performing at work in lockdown, caring for a 14-month old at home, while going through a painful breakup and very little sleep. Yeah… Do I have a choice? I don’t, in fact. The one thing I cannot do, while I know the likelihood of separation is high, the single thing I cannot do, is lose my job. And worse even, lose my ability to work, by means of a breakdown. I come from a very modest background, born in communist Romania, raised in a 50-square meter flat in a Romanian provincial town, on my mom’s low income, the equivalent of a couple of hundred euros nowadays. I’ve come a long way from there, but I’ve no real safety net. My parents can’t help me and nobody else can, at this point. My husband and I are pretty much on our own. If we separate and I break down in the process, it’s all over. I’m going to fall deeply, badly. If I were on my own that would still be OK, but I have a baby to take care of. My job and my ability to work are all I have, really. Only I am gradually failing. How the hell not, I now wonder. But at that moment I could not possibly let that happen, so I fight my way through each working day. Working remotely allows me to partially hide the fact that I am dead tired, that I struggle to focus even through reading an email and that often, I have tears in my eyes. I have a great job, which normally I enjoy a lot. I do brand management and product innovation for a brand I love and believe in. The job, however, is anything but easy. It’s complex, demanding, multi-leveled and the responsibility is high. The innovation projects I lead locally are often cross-european and involve strict commitments with external parties and clients, which cannot be broken. Fine coordination of several unrelated teams and functions is needed, as well as the creative work with external agencies. Clearly there is also a lot more work than is achievable, the teams and budgets are shrinking and the financial pressure to deliver successful products is high. It’s a dance I play well, under normal circumstances. But now I’m starting to fail. I sometimes miss my appointments. I forget to prepare for important meetings and I forget the details on my many projects. I forget deadlines, I fail to do my follow-up and sometimes I stop keeping track of most things, except topline. I’m terrified that people will start noticing and they do. But I cannot describe to them what is really happening, what I’m going through. I must get my shit together and carry on. My manager and a few closer colleagues begin to guess, however. I’m lucky to have her, my manager. She’s incredibly supportive and has my back as much as she can, even though her own life is also complicated in lockdown with a small child at home. I’ll never forget this, I say to myself, I’ll never forget her for doing this. Somehow, with her support, I manage to pull through most of my projects and nothing really bad happens. Nevertheless, I am exhausted and keep running behind everything. We split working days, with my husband, we each get to work 4 hours, while the other takes care of our daughter. The rest of the work, we do after hours in the evening, after she has gone to sleep. We obviously fight about this, we fight about how to handle her and he keeps blaming me for everything, including this situation. I cannot sleep much at night, I often have bad anxiety attacks which keep me awake. My therapist prescribed several types of sleeping pills, from light to strong, to very strong. None of it really works. At best, I can sleep for four hours, not more. One day I wake up driving on the wrong side of the road. The car driving towards me honks hard and avoids me. I start each working day in a thick haze. No amount of coffee will help. Daily, I resolve to gather all my forces to catch up on things. But I cannot muster up the needed focus to even read my emails. I look at the long queue and I pick the ones I estimate are most urgent. I get the topic, but I cannot possibly understand the meaning of this phrase. By the time I’ve finished reading it, I forget how it begins, so I keep reading the same phrase over and over again. I don’t understand what I need to do, as a result of what is written in this phrase. Making that connection is more than my severely sleep-deprived brain can do right now. My very sharp, logic, well-structured brain is failing me. It feels like the ground is melting from underneath my feet, once more. I almost cannot recognise myself, the wreck that I am. I feel deeply ashamed. My husband is right, I am worthless. I am a complete failure. With my therapist, when we talk, I don’t even get to mention this. The topic of me failing at work doesn’t get any space in those very precious 45-minute sessions. I need those sessions badly now, they keep me afloat, to some extent. I can face the disaster at home a little better in the days after my session. Every time a little better, I feel. After a few months of this, my therapist does prescribe two weeks of sick leave. I need this so much, but I feel terribly guilty to take them. It’s hard for me to accept that I’m toast. This continues for a full year, in various forms. Sometimes I get back on my feet a little. Sometimes I manage to keep things reasonably together, at work. But the madness is always very close by. Looking through my phone, I found this text, written in those days: I took my daughter for a walk today in the rain. We do this to give my husband some space. I feel he doesn’t want us there, but we have nowhere to go, there’s a pandemic out there, so we just walk in the rain. A very old man with a bag of food waved and smiled at us, as he walked by, socially distancing. I felt so alone I cried. A dream I wrote down, also from those days: The night before he announced he would leave, I dreamt he left us, my daughter and I, in a majestic church with huge glass-stained art and many elevators. He disappeared as the bells started tolling. The bells were announcing war. We took an elevator and it went deep down in the ground underneath the church. More: My brain is how I make sense of the world and it stopped working now. The therapist says we navigate the world through our emotions. We’re talking divorce and I have no idea how to navigate that with my emotions. Fuck that, I’ve got my brain. Only it won’t restart. Not today, not last week, not for a while now. If only I could get it back working I could figure this out. Hold on, hold on, get up! Get.The.Fuck.Up I tell myself incessantly. “Be a pineapple”, reads a motivational quote my colleagues sent me. “Stand tall, wear a crown and be sweet on the inside”. And then, right through that crown, I get Covid, obviously. Or the pineapple does, as it happens. (…) -- -- A story every (other) day for the next 30 days (or so).

212,Long Covid Has an Inclusivity Problem,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story F. Perry Wilson, MD MSCE Follow -- 9 Share I want to help people suffering from long covid as much as anyone. But we have a real problem. In brief, we are being too inclusive. The first thing you learn, when you start studying the epidemiology of diseases, is that you need a good case definition. And our case definition for long covid sucks. Just last week, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) issued a definition of long covid with the aim of “improving consistency, documentation and treatment”. Good news, right? Here’s the definition. “Long COVID is an infection-associated chronic condition that occurs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and is present for at least 3 months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems.” This is not helpful. The symptoms can be in any organ system, can be continuous or relapsing and remitting. Basically, if you had COVID — and essentially all of us have by now — and you have any symptom, even one that comes and goes, for three months after that — it’s long covid. They don’t even specify that the symptom has to be new. I’m not saying that long covid doesn’t exist. I’m not saying it isn’t weird or that it can’t present in diverse ways. But a case definition… -- -- 9 Medicine, science, statistics. Associate Professor of Medicine and Public Health at Yale. New book “How Medicine Works and When it Doesn’t” available now.

213,Reluctantly Maturing Gen Xer,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Darya Mead Follow -- Listen Share Attempting to Age Well in a Fraying America 1965 — the year I was born — the first combat troops were sent to Vietnam, Malcom X was assassinated and the Sound of Music was the top grossing film. It was a long time ago. I’m actually on the cusp of the Baby Boomer era, but consider myself a Gen X-er in every way. So as I move towards my 59th birthday — and my first born turns 25 — I have been reflecting on aging, my family legacy and my own relationship to the whole darn process. Having just recovered from my first bout of Covid — which my Dr. friend said was mild, and given the debate about Biden’s fitness for candidacy — I have been musing a bit more than usual on health, wellness and youthful vigor. In a weird way, finally getting Covid — after multiple exposures and relentless vigilance, where I had finally loosened a bit — was sort of a relief. To finally succumb to the strain that has been dubbed ‘The Kraken’ was humbling, weird, non linear and vexing, but also gave me a more nuanced perspective on the whole chaotic pandemic mess and how so many have suffered. A whisper of fragility — some PTSD from a bout of mono in my 20’s — and the long tail of recovery, makes you think and be grateful for health. More than a month out from testing positive, I feel pretty much back to normal, except I swam laps today and have lost stamina. A recent hike was challenging; or at least felt more so than before The Kraken. I’ll take it, a little unproductive cough, some odd larynx inflammation and a little less energy. All in all, my general fitness and health, vaccination and boosts, and my ‘luxury’ in being able to stay home/ work from home helped a lot, along with some acupuncture, gentle yoga, good nourishing food and lots of rest. Unfortunately this is not a comfort everyone enjoys in America, where now, friends are headed back to work after 5 days and told to just wear a mask. Since I had Covid, I’ve had 3 encounters that have really shaken or shifted my perspective on aging well. The first involved a Lyft driver in Seattle, I’ll call Miranda. A single mom of 5 kids, I only learned she was in her mid-forties at the end of a ride that involved some pretty deep conversation about race, politics, poverty, obesity and health. I had assumed she was about my age. As an aside, I don’t use Uber/ Lyft that often if I can help it, but I would say besides new immigrants, most of my drivers have been single moms; so that tells you a lot about the American economy. Yeah it’s an OK gig for a mom, you can make your own schedule etc., but everyone I talk to says they don’t make enough money. Although, Miranda said she was applying to ferry foster kids to supervised parental visits; a supposedly lucrative offshoot with an understandably onerous application process. A savvy white woman with bi-racial kids, she was hoping to get a gastric bypass to help her lose weight and stay alive and healthy for her kids. We talked about movement and how she has spots she gets out of the car and does circuits. I heard about one bright, motivated daughter who wants to go to med-school and encouraged her to support her in applying to some top schools where she might get a great aid package. UW — where both my kids are studying — is a top school for pre-med, so we talked about that too. She also told me about two friends, one who went blind because of her out of control diabetes, and another who has had terribly long Covid. Anyway, the more than an hour long ride bore many profound tangents. I wished her well and gave her a phat tip. The second interaction was at a QFC; a Safeway-like supermarket in Sequim Washington. I stopped in to buy strawberries and asparagus and a bottle of white wine. I was visiting my 91 year old mother-in-law who has volunteer rhubarb in her backyard. I usually visit in August /September, but this year it was early July and the copious blackberry bushes were just flowering. Normally I make blackberry jam, and last year I made blackberry rhubarb jam which was extra yummy, tart, sweet, tangy, with not too many seeds. They get stuck in my teeth and create havoc all day if I have no access to dental floss; yet another random aging issue. So… at checkout, a very hardscrabble looking woman carded me. I joked that I was old, and showed her my driver’s license. She hesitated, crumpled her face and looked at me and said she was 8 years younger than me and I looked great. Note to self, don’t say you’re old, when confronted with someone who has seemingly lived a hard life… but stay tuned for interaction #3. We giggled together, had a moment, and I left wondering what her life was like. Certainly she had smoked, but what situation — beyond unfortunate genetics — leads a woman to look 70 at age 50? I will say, if a woman has a few extra pounds and is moderately fit, I think it is a more youthful look than the obsessively thin look Hollywood would have us assume is desired, but maybe I’m just making excuses, because the struggle is real. I do know, shitty healthcare, an economy that punishes women and possible addiction are devastating psychically and physically. Both she and Miranda (who admitted making poor choices in men) sadly are not alone. Struggling to raise kids alone and earn a living, fighting many nefarious forces internal and external, is exhausting, unhealthy and saps vitality. I thought about her as I stirred my bubbling jam later that night. Cut to a public swimming pool right outside San Francisco for interaction number three on my aging revelation tour. I swim — or try to — twice a week. I do about 20–30 laps and have an entire dorky routine with flippers, ear plugs and a kickboard. I have been doing the same routine for 35 years. I always think of my dad who died in 2018. He did his outdated Canadian Air Force exercises until about age 80; the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. He also had a hard time with aging and looked quite young until he had a triple bypass at age 76. My mom is now 86 and looks great. So I guess genetics are somewhat on my side. Both my parents were social workers and deeply empathic people, but both prone to occasional vanity. I am beginning to truly understand that inheritance, yet still not ready to stop dyeing my hair; as good as my silver haired sisters look. It was my first time back doing laps post Covid. I swim any chance I get, but the actual laps are another beast. There was a new ‘green’ lifeguard for summer running the desk. He seemed younger than my kids and a bit floppy and unsure. There were issues with the computer, so when I finally paid, he quoted me $9. I said: “I’m a senior.” I had realized a few months ago — finally seeing the entrance fees posted up — that the senior rate starts at age 55. This made my day when I discovered the senior discount was $6, and am hell bent to take advantage of it. He looked at me with his puppy dog eyes and apologized and said: “sorry, but you look so young.” We laughed and I offered to show him my license, but he said it was OK. I had a great swim, albeit with a bit less stamina… onwards. It’s hard not to fret daily on the micro and macro level. I just got a call from my mechanic and my 11 year-old car needs new brakes and a radiator and other stuff; price tag $1932. How can one ever get ahead? So many — particularly women — are one check engine light away from hunger, unemployment and/ or homelessness. There has to be a better way to live, age and thrive, and to take better care of ourselves, our children, our aging parents, our community and the planet. I’m feeling a bit ostrich-y of late regarding many current events and trying to focus on the positive things I can do for myself and others. I don’t know what will happen with the election, Gaza, Reproductive Rights, Climate Change and any litany of potential disasters. I’m just trying to be present, active, aware of others’ challenges and move through my days with grace and humor. Writing, moving my body, doing good work and laughing helps me synergize and keep it as much together as I can. -- -- Writer, Producer, Media Manager and Mom in San Francisco, Darya writes about travel, parenting, food and health and wellness for TV, print, and online outlets.

Yet, for many, lasting health complications persist as part of long COVID. These symptoms vary, but it’s increasingly evident that some cases start with lung damage. From mild annoyances to severe symptoms, its impact is a shadow that lingers just out of sight. Despite this, we have, for the most part, moved on from lockdowns, social distancing, mask mandates, and even vaccinations. A brief look at vaccination numbers from the start of the pandemic to today reveals that after 2023, the total count of administered vaccines has flatlined. Interpret this data how you will, but one thing is certain: we don’t view COVID-19 at the same level of danger as we once did. COVID-19 feels like it’s become a part of history — something we’ve moved past. Yet, the reality is quite different.

No friends or comrades to sit alongside (we are living in a pandemic, Winston!) so I called my friends on the phone where we held conversation virtually all throughout the night. My family, however, started to take note of my inebriated behaviour. “Are you alright?” My mother asked. “Yuh, I’m ph..fine.” Fearful of further embarrassment, I made my way back upstairs. At this point, Churchill would be on the brandy, but thus came my eventual downfall. It was now midnight, and for Churchill he would have just finished dinner with guests and was now ready to work all through the late night. “He would write past bedtime for most people, often till 3 am. Reinvigorated by his afternoon nap,” said Langworth. “Churchill would be on the brandy, but thus came my eventual downfall” Everything I had done to this point had led me to this moment. I was keen to immerse myself in further work, but to no avail. I managed to spill drink all over my cream jumper and write a pitiful 200 words of the article you are reading now. Andrew Roberts, another historian of Churchill’s, told me before I tried this: “I’d set by a day to recover as well as the day of being WSC.” With this in mind, I chose to call it a day knowing the consequences of the next morning. Solely based on how I was feeling several hours later, I would not recommend Churchill’s routine. But hangovers aside, I came to the conclusion that Churchill’s routine made perfect sense. Sure, I do not advocate alcoholism by any stretch of the matter, but Cole Felix, a PhD student who studied Churchill, says his routine reveals an essential principle for success: knowing how to “get things done”, whatever the setting. “It’s tempting to say that he works hard when he is working and plays hard when he is playing. But that would be to miscategorise the nature of his work.” As unorthodox as it may be, Churchill’s routine allowed him to achieve a great deal during the latter — and most important years — of his life. We can learn a thing or two from his daily routines amid the stresses of the coronavirus crisis, like taking leisure and relaxation time into consideration, as well as making a routine that you want to follow rather than one you have to follow. Perhaps by looking at a unique — and special — individual like Churchill, a well thorough routine may be the key to help accomplish the goals we strive to achieve (and never surrender). -- -- 2 Political journalist and ink slinger Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "
216,The Chronicles of a Broken Marriage — Part III,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Lexy G Follow -- Listen Share Pause. I’m pressing pause for a while to zoom out and look at the bigger context in which my personal drama is unfolding. It’s really not all fucking hot guys in mirrors and fingering in the forest. There’s Covid, there’s new motherhood and there’s work. How to keep performing at work in lockdown, caring for a 14-month old at home, while going through a painful breakup and very little sleep. Yeah… Do I have a choice? I don’t, in fact. The one thing I cannot do, while I know the likelihood of separation is high, the single thing I cannot do, is lose my job. And worse even, lose my ability to work, by means of a breakdown. I come from a very modest background, born in communist Romania, raised in a 50-square meter flat in a Romanian provincial town, on my mom’s low income, the equivalent of a couple of hundred euros nowadays. I’ve come a long way from there, but I’ve no real safety net. My parents can’t help me and nobody else can, at this point. My husband and I are pretty much on our own. If we separate and I break down in the process, it’s all over. I’m going to fall deeply, badly. If I were on my own that would still be OK, but I have a baby to take care of. My job and my ability to work are all I have, really. Only I am gradually failing. How the hell not, I now wonder. But at that moment I could not possibly let that happen, so I fight my way through each working day. Working remotely allows me to partially hide the fact that I am dead tired, that I struggle to focus even through reading an email and that often, I have tears in my eyes. I have a great job, which normally I enjoy a lot. I do brand management and product innovation for a brand I love and believe in. The job, however, is anything but easy. It’s complex, demanding, multi-leveled and the responsibility is high. The innovation projects I lead locally are often cross-european and involve strict commitments with external parties and clients, which cannot be broken. Fine coordination of several unrelated teams and functions is needed, as well as the creative work with external agencies. Clearly there is also a lot more work than is achievable, the teams and budgets are shrinking and the financial pressure to deliver successful products is high. It’s a dance I play well, under normal circumstances. But now I’m starting to fail. I sometimes miss my appointments. I forget to prepare for important meetings and I forget the details on my many projects. I forget deadlines, I fail to do my follow-up and sometimes I stop keeping track of most things, except topline. I’m terrified that people will start noticing and they do. But I cannot describe to them what is really happening, what I’m going through. I must get my shit together and carry on. My manager and a few closer colleagues begin to guess, however. I’m lucky to have her, my manager. She’s incredibly supportive and has my back as much as she can, even though her own life is also complicated in lockdown with a small child at home. I’ll never forget this, I say to myself, I’ll never forget her for doing this. Somehow, with her support, I manage to pull through most of my projects and nothing really bad happens. Nevertheless, I am exhausted and keep running behind everything. We split working days, with my husband, we each get to work 4 hours, while the other takes care of our daughter. The rest of the work, we do after hours in the evening, after she has gone to sleep. We obviously fight about this, we fight about how to handle her and he keeps blaming me for everything, including this situation. I cannot sleep much at night, I often have bad anxiety attacks which keep me awake. My therapist prescribed several types of sleeping pills, from light to strong, to very strong. None of it really works. At best, I can sleep for four hours, not more. One day I wake up driving on the wrong side of the road. The car driving towards me honks hard and avoids me. I start each working day in a thick haze. No amount of coffee will help. Daily, I resolve to gather all my forces to catch up on things. But I cannot muster up the needed focus to even read my emails. I look at the long queue and I pick the ones I estimate are most urgent. I get the topic, but I cannot possibly understand the meaning of this phrase. By the time I’ve finished reading it, I forget how it begins, so I keep reading the same phrase over and over again. I don’t understand what I need to do, as a result of what is written in this phrase. Making that connection is more than my severely sleep-deprived brain can do right now. My very sharp, logic, well-structured brain is failing me. It feels like the ground is melting from underneath my feet, once more. I almost cannot recognise myself, the wreck that I am. I feel deeply ashamed. My husband is right, I am worthless. I am a complete failure. With my therapist, when we talk, I don’t even get to mention this. The topic of me failing at work doesn’t get any space in those very precious 45-minute sessions. I need those sessions badly now, they keep me afloat, to some extent. I can face the disaster at home a little better in the days after my session. Every time a little better, I feel. After a few months of this, my therapist does prescribe two weeks of sick leave. I need this so much, but I feel terribly guilty to take them. It’s hard for me to accept that I’m toast. This continues for a full year, in various forms. Sometimes I get back on my feet a little. Sometimes I manage to keep things reasonably together, at work. But the madness is always very close by. Looking through my phone, I found this text, written in those days: I took my daughter for a walk today in the rain. We do this to give my husband some space. I feel he doesn’t want us there, but we have nowhere to go, there’s a pandemic out there, so we just walk in the rain. A very old man with a bag of food waved and smiled at us, as he walked by, socially distancing. I felt so alone I cried. A dream I wrote down, also from those days: The night before he announced he would leave, I dreamt he left us, my daughter and I, in a majestic church with huge glass-stained art and many elevators. He disappeared as the bells started tolling. The bells were announcing war. We took an elevator and it went deep down in the ground underneath the church. More: My brain is how I make sense of the world and it stopped working now. The therapist says we navigate the world through our emotions. We’re talking divorce and I have no idea how to navigate that with my emotions. Fuck that, I’ve got my brain. Only it won’t restart. Not today, not last week, not for a while now. If only I could get it back working I could figure this out. Hold on, hold on, get up! Get.The.Fuck.Up I tell myself incessantly. “Be a pineapple”, reads a motivational quote my colleagues sent me. “Stand tall, wear a crown and be sweet on the inside”. And then, right through that crown, I get Covid, obviously. Or the pineapple does, as it happens. (…) -- -- A story every (other) day for the next 30 days (or so).

217,Long Covid Has an Inclusivity Problem,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story F. Perry Wilson, MD MSCE Follow -- 9 Share I want to help people suffering from long covid as much as anyone. But we have a real problem. In brief, we are being too inclusive. The first thing you learn, when you start studying the epidemiology of diseases, is that you need a good case definition. And our case definition for long covid sucks. Just last week, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) issued a definition of long covid with the aim of “improving consistency, documentation and treatment”. Good news, right? Here’s the definition. “Long COVID is an infection-associated chronic condition that occurs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and is present for at least 3 months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems.” This is not helpful. The symptoms can be in any organ system, can be continuous or relapsing and remitting. Basically, if you had COVID — and essentially all of us have by now — and you have any symptom, even one that comes and goes, for three months after that — it’s long covid. They don’t even specify that the symptom has to be new. I’m not saying that long covid doesn’t exist. I’m not saying it isn’t weird or that it can’t present in diverse ways.

218,"US COVID Update for July 7, 2024: Infections High in Parts of US, and the CDC Takes a Vacation After Quietly Strengthening Guidance","Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Augie Ray Follow -- 1 Listen Share This week, the US CDC discreetly increased its warnings about the risks of COVID, and then promptly took a holiday vacation. It did this despite the fact COVID is very high in select spots of the US and rising generally nationwide. Here is this week’s update on COVID-19 in the United States: While most of the nation pretends COVID is gone, the CDC upgraded its language and urged more caution. But, it made the change stealthily. The CDC this week acknowledged that COVID is not a seasonal virus like the flu or RSV. The update noted that COVID “can surge throughout the year” and that “surges outside the winter season will likely continue as long as new variants emerge and immunity decreases over time.” It also acknowledged that “Although COVID-19 is not the threat it once was, it is still associated with thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths each week in the United States, and can lead to Long COVID.” (The CDC is not entirely correct with his statement. While it is accurate to say COVID is not the acute threat it once was, it is actually a greater threat today to long-term health due to the increased risk associated with repeat infections.) The CDC also subtly urged more caution — a message most Americans will not hear or heed. “During the summer and throughout the year, you can use many effective tools to prevent spreading COVID-19 or becoming seriously ill… COVID-19 is here to stay, but taking simple actions will help protect you and your loved ones from infection and serious illness.” The release noted that the CDC continues to “publish weekly data so that the public can make informed decisions regarding their individual risk throughout the year.” The statement is rather ironic, since this week, with much of the nation seeing rising COVID risks, the CDC’s National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) (which is the best data we have to track COVID viral activity) took the holiday week off and did not provide a weekly update. Despite the lack of NWSS data this week, we know the US is in a summer COVID surge. While much of our monitoring system has been dismantled in the last year or two, we still have valid sources of information, including: Together, these three data sources convey the same story: The US is seeing rising levels of COVID infections throughout the country. COVID risks are wildly uneven. Last week’s NWSS update noted that COVID levels in wastewater are more than three times higher in the West than in the Midwest and Northeast. But even that doesn’t tell the story of how different localities are seeing considerably different COVID levels. The Wastewaterscan.org data, while incomplete, demonstrates that: This should not need to be said, but since so many are ignoring COVID’s longer-term risks, it bears repeating: While the risks of severe acute disease have decreased in recent years, evidence continues to mount that each infection can damage your brain, heart, immune system, and leave a significant share of people with Long COVID. For years, I’ve collected research studies that demonstrate the impact COVID can have on our bodies. My spreadsheet surpassed 700 studies as of this week. Recent research has revealed: You can find links to these and other studies on the health impacts of COVID in my Google spreadsheet. I regularly must defend myself against people who take an all-or-nothing attitude about COVID precautions. They think there is a bipolar choice between two extremes: Doing absolutely nothing or isolating endlessly. This is a false dichotomy. (It’s like suggesting you can either drive drunk or lock your car in your garage, with no alternatives in between.) There are, in fact, simple things we could do collectively, as well as actions we can take individually to limit risks to ourselves and those we love. We could probably wipe almost all COVID surges, greatly reduce the pace of viral evolution, and turn it into a normal respiratory virus that only reappears in winter with very modest collective action. In other words, we could reduce the risk of COVID to the levels we only pretend they are today. To do so, we would need to: Of course, none of those collective responses are imminent, which means it’s up to each of us individually to protect ourselves and those around us. With small sacrifices, we could be safe: Knowledge is power. There is no need for fear, but being informed, adjusting your behaviors to match risks, and taking just a little more caution can do much to keep you and your family safe from chronic damage to your health and wellbeing.

He was rushed to the INTEGRIS Health Edmond Hospital emergency room via ambulance where he tested positive for both COVID-19 and pneumonia. The now-retired U.S. Army officer will be honored Friday, July 12 as the INTEGRIS Health “Home Run For Life” series continues during the 2024 OKC Baseball Club season at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark. “Home Run For Life” recognizes individuals in the community who have overcome a significant medical event with the help of their families, physicians and health care professionals. To symbolize the end of their battle against adversity, honorees take a home run “lap” around the bases during a pregame ceremony. At the hospital, Dominguez’s body would not respond to medicine or a ventilator and his heart and lungs could not function on their own. He was quickly transferred to the Nazih Zuhdi Transplant Institute at INTEGRIS Health Baptist Medical Center. Dominguez underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO for short. The treatment essentially acts as a working set of heart and lungs for patients in critical condition and is often considered a “last hope” for critical patients. “It saved my life,” he said. While undergoing treatment, Dominguez spent 56 days in a medically induced coma as his body recovered and his lungs and heart rested and healed. Dominguez stayed in the hospital for almost 90 days and is beyond grateful for the care and support the staff and physicians at INTEGRIS Health provided him. He is one of more than 1,000 patients whose lives have been saved thanks to the INTEGRIS Health ECMO program, headquartered at the Nazih Zuhdi Transplant Institute at INTEGRIS Health Baptist Medical Center. “If it wasn’t for INTEGRIS, I wouldn’t be here,” he said. “The things they did were remarkable.” Dominguez has since been medically discharged from the military as he continues his recovery and his experience has given him a new perspective on life. “I’m just lucky to be here,” he said. Dominguez now has more time to spend with his family, including his six children. He even plans to coauthor a book about his medical miracle with his wife Megan. He echoes his contagious positivity to everyone he meets and looks forward to everything life has to offer. “It’s a blessing and journey,” Dominguez said. -- -- Beyond the Bricks Oklahoma City Dodgers Communications Assistant Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "

It is a Herculean task for most children. The ways children feel and think make their experience different from adults. And in those differences, it is challenging to help them with their grief. We use gentle words and reassurances that may be totally inept at comforting their obvious pain. Children inhabit the world of magical thinking, for better or worse. They tend to believe that they are responsible for things over which they actually have little control. They have ideas about why bad things happen that have little to do with reality. If Mom is sick, it’s because I was bad. I can do things to make Dad un-sick, un-dead. Grown-up concepts of time are meaningless. What is soon? What does a minute or a week mean? What is forever?

224,Why the Youth Are Rapidly Dying Younger,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Prince Hackman Arkoh Follow -- Listen Share Some many, many years ago, most people averagely died after two to even five centuries after being born (200 to 500 year old folks). As at that time when they were teenagers or in their early to late 20s, they’d make a tall list of what they’d want their life to become in the next 70 years – I mean life goals; they knew they won’t be turning into food for the maggots any time soon. To make some Biblical references, we knew of Methuselah who reportedly, is the world’s oldest person in history at the age of 969 (amazing how he lived almost within a full millennium). But for almost two to three centuries now, we have gotten to accept the fact that the expiry date of man isn’t any further after a 70th birthday celebration. Surprisingly, we still have people who were born within the 1890s and 1930s era still standing strong, breathing fresh air each day as of 2024 (obviously over 70 years of age); bet they could win last man standing contests in aging. My grandfather passed in 2019, he was 110 years old at that time; funny enough, I was told he was past the 110 but they had to input 110 because they couldn’t remember his actual birthyear. There are people who are alive and at the age of my late Grandpa when he died who still walk in strength. But the question is, why are folks born within the 21st Century dying young, as at age 18, 25, 40, 50, and more so, dying rapidly?Before we tackle the question in the previous sentence, let’s ask ourselves these: what is the secret of people over 80 years on their journey to longevity? I mean how did they do it? Was it magic or a supernatural doing?It isn’t magic in anyway; we can explain how they did it in two categories: their environment and lifestyle, using Ghana, my country as the instance. Their EnvironmentIf you had the opportunity to ask one of the oldies on their secrets to longevity, they’d tell you that: back in their days, their environment was much Heavenly. Their atmosphere wasn’t filled with too much greenhouse gasses which are the major reasons for the annually worsening global warming. Their air was soothing to take up into the nostrils, nothing too polluting to negatively affect their lungs. Their water bodies were not polluted at that time; they had the privilege to drink more purer forms of drinking water, to fulfill the body’s need for good water for its various processes that help the body function properly. Their lands were filled with more trees (probably as much as beach sand) for good air, more fruits and healthy livestock for good health when they consumed them. Also, they didn’t have to worry about impacts of radioactivity from electronic devices as technology wasn’t ubiquitous back then. There wasn’t social media at that time to cause depression, distractions and promote hate speech; in fact, they were very happy. They made soothing music from nature, had daily social gatherings to play indigenous games, laughed, danced and had fun. Their towns were not filled with disturbing noises from the night clubs; they had non-disrupted peace of mind.LifestyleHow they lived life back then were a huge contribution to their longevity. First of all, their eating habits were in proper ways. Back in the days they didn’t have noodles; all they had were green leafy soups, rich palm oils for stews, coconut oils for their fries, the popular Fufu, more mangoes and sugarcanes. They ate on time too; you wouldn’t come across a Ghanaian home at that era preparing dinner at 7pm. Their sleep wasn’t disturbed since they had peace of mind and no social media interruptions. They slept on time and woke up early morn to feel the glory of good Sunlight. They took very good care of their bodies; they were more times jogging and performing cardio, they made medicine from herbs to feel the full healing power of the forests and they also stayed away from hard drugs, alcohol and drinking (for the drinking aspect Ghanaian oldies were into it but were taking in authentic wine from palm plant). I came across the YouTube video below which is a real-life testament to the oldies’ secrets to longevity. Click below to watch… https://youtu.be/xS1GsJGtNSw?si=XKHhLsGBnQB2tDoD So back to our main issue, What Changed?Currently, the major cause of early deaths is death from illnesses, especially chronic and infectious diseases (World Health Organisation, 2020). Now, as of 2024, the Global warming rate is very high and more amounts of lethal radiations are getting through the Earth’s Ozone layer, which are detrimental to our health. The air is too polluted now, especially with industrial waste that people are scared to do their routine reps of “breathe-in, breathe-out” lung exercise. There aren’t more trees like before anymore to give us good air as they’re being cut down every day so the lands can be used for industrial and commercial purposes. Too much chemicals and fertilizers are used to grow crops to give enormous fruit and crop growth; we eat these foods and get complications due to these chemicals.We drink too much alcohol, use cigarettes and take in hard drugs. Now due to the fact that many sexually active men and women want to last longer in bed and impress their partners, they use sexually enhancing drugs or aphrodisiacs like Viagra and Dragon Spray, which are all sure tickets to kidney failure and Liver damage. We take in too much fats, oils and sugar by consuming junk foods and fast foods; our livers can’t bear the load of neutralizing the effects of our unhealthy dieting habits. What’s worse, we don’t eat on time; someone out there is taking in a whole pizza at 11:30 pm and will sleep right after eating. It’s like we don’t care for our bodies and the effects and complications like Stroke, Cancers, heart diseases, kidney complications and liver problems show up at age 15, 18, 25, 30, and subsequently cause early and rapid deaths.Now, we are more exposed to radiation from electronic devices like never before – millions use phones and computers each day, don’t they? There’s too much noise everywhere. Social media is causing insecurities leading to depression to people most of the time; they’d now commit suicide because the environment around us now and everything it presents to us is very much depressing.We have polluted our water bodies with industrial waste and plastics, and through illegal mining, and we end up using heavy metals to treat the water for consumption; we take in this seemingly “treated water” and end up hurting our kidneys due to heavy metals used in water treatment.We be on our mobile devices late at night, spend half of the night overthinking and having unproductive convos, ending up not sleeping early. Didn’t the Doctors advice that we have 8 undistracted hours of sleep each day? We rather have 3 to 5 hours of sleep which subsequently affects our health as it has been reported that poor sleep patterns equated to poor health, then shortened life span (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022).Now, we see exercising as a waste of time; we would rather eat (the junks), sleep, sleep, eat, repeat. Sadly, most people who exercise or workout don’t do so for the sake of the heart. Most gym lovers workout to build the glutes, biceps, abs and thighs instead of making sure the heart is smiling widely inside their chests. What Can the Youth Do Now?Unfortunately, with the growing rates of the environmental issues, coupled with people’s alarming addictions to unhealthy lifestyle, the lifespan of humans might as well be reduced to 50 years. But, little steps compound to cover a thousand-mile journey. That means there’s still chance for the Youth to live long by taking small steps to good health daily (I recommend you read these two books at this point: ‘Atomic Habits’ by James Clear, and ‘Fit Forever: One-a-day Devotionals for Body, Mind and Spirit’ by Kay Kuzma). For this to be achieved, the youth can: reduce screen time, eat more fruits and veggies and reduce the junks, do more cardio exercises for good heart health; desist totally from alcohol use and smoking, have time for meditations which can relieve them of psychological stress, sleep on time, shouldn’t abuse medical prescriptions and perform good personal hygiene practices. Final ThoughtsI believe strongly in living healthily but one thing’s for sure, we will leave this world behind and besides, we can’t be too careful because what you thought won’t matter might be the cause of your death (the movie, Final Destination made me realize this). As Avicii (R.I.P to him) said in his song “The Nights”, “He said one day you’ll live this world behind, so live a life you will remember…”, life is to be lived to the fullest. Many think living life fully means having tons of sex, boozing, partying, smoking, eating burgers and sugars every day, but that’s not the case at all. It rather involves smiling more, spending time with the people you love, travelling around the world, eating well, having positive mindset and doing the “healthy” things you love; all contributing to good health one way or another, increasing lifespan.

I didn’t know what was left in her bowels ever since she stopped eating and walking the day before. The vet said to expect this. She would die soon and all I could see was her torso moving up and down, a clear indication of her breath. That day it was so noticeable. All the eighteen years prior, it never occurred to me to notice her breath. “Today,” I thought, “she breathes. Therefore, she lives. Tomorrow — we’ll see.” Same with you and me. Today we breathe. I’ve lived most of my life, or all of it, never noticing my breath. Sure, sometimes my breathing stands out and rattles me — as when I exercise hard, gasp in surprise, hold my breath under water then burst with an exhale as I emerge, or when I’m scared or angry.

It is a Herculean task for most children. The ways children feel and think make their experience different from adults. And in those differences, it is challenging to help them with their grief. We use gentle words and reassurances that may be totally inept at comforting their obvious pain. Children inhabit the world of magical thinking, for better or worse. They tend to believe that they are responsible for things over which they actually have little control. They have ideas about why bad things happen that have little to do with reality. If Mom is sick, it’s because I was bad. I can do things to make Dad un-sick, un-dead. Grown-up concepts of time are meaningless. What is soon? What does a minute or a week mean? What is forever?

229,Why the Youth Are Rapidly Dying Younger,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Prince Hackman Arkoh Follow -- Listen Share Some many, many years ago, most people averagely died after two to even five centuries after being born (200 to 500 year old folks). As at that time when they were teenagers or in their early to late 20s, they’d make a tall list of what they’d want their life to become in the next 70 years – I mean life goals; they knew they won’t be turning into food for the maggots any time soon. To make some Biblical references, we knew of Methuselah who reportedly, is the world’s oldest person in history at the age of 969 (amazing how he lived almost within a full millennium). But for almost two to three centuries now, we have gotten to accept the fact that the expiry date of man isn’t any further after a 70th birthday celebration. Surprisingly, we still have people who were born within the 1890s and 1930s era still standing strong, breathing fresh air each day as of 2024 (obviously over 70 years of age); bet they could win last man standing contests in aging. My grandfather passed in 2019, he was 110 years old at that time; funny enough, I was told he was past the 110 but they had to input 110 because they couldn’t remember his actual birthyear. There are people who are alive and at the age of my late Grandpa when he died who still walk in strength. But the question is, why are folks born within the 21st Century dying young, as at age 18, 25, 40, 50, and more so, dying rapidly?Before we tackle the question in the previous sentence, let’s ask ourselves these: what is the secret of people over 80 years on their journey to longevity? I mean how did they do it? Was it magic or a supernatural doing?It isn’t magic in anyway; we can explain how they did it in two categories: their environment and lifestyle, using Ghana, my country as the instance. Their EnvironmentIf you had the opportunity to ask one of the oldies on their secrets to longevity, they’d tell you that: back in their days, their environment was much Heavenly. Their atmosphere wasn’t filled with too much greenhouse gasses which are the major reasons for the annually worsening global warming. Their air was soothing to take up into the nostrils, nothing too polluting to negatively affect their lungs. Their water bodies were not polluted at that time; they had the privilege to drink more purer forms of drinking water, to fulfill the body’s need for good water for its various processes that help the body function properly. Their lands were filled with more trees (probably as much as beach sand) for good air, more fruits and healthy livestock for good health when they consumed them. Also, they didn’t have to worry about impacts of radioactivity from electronic devices as technology wasn’t ubiquitous back then. There wasn’t social media at that time to cause depression, distractions and promote hate speech; in fact, they were very happy. They made soothing music from nature, had daily social gatherings to play indigenous games, laughed, danced and had fun. Their towns were not filled with disturbing noises from the night clubs; they had non-disrupted peace of mind.LifestyleHow they lived life back then were a huge contribution to their longevity. First of all, their eating habits were in proper ways. Back in the days they didn’t have noodles; all they had were green leafy soups, rich palm oils for stews, coconut oils for their fries, the popular Fufu, more mangoes and sugarcanes. They ate on time too; you wouldn’t come across a Ghanaian home at that era preparing dinner at 7pm. Their sleep wasn’t disturbed since they had peace of mind and no social media interruptions. They slept on time and woke up early morn to feel the glory of good Sunlight. They took very good care of their bodies; they were more times jogging and performing cardio, they made medicine from herbs to feel the full healing power of the forests and they also stayed away from hard drugs, alcohol and drinking (for the drinking aspect Ghanaian oldies were into it but were taking in authentic wine from palm plant). I came across the YouTube video below which is a real-life testament to the oldies’ secrets to longevity. Click below to watch… https://youtu.be/xS1GsJGtNSw?si=XKHhLsGBnQB2tDoD So back to our main issue, What Changed?Currently, the major cause of early deaths is death from illnesses, especially chronic and infectious diseases (World Health Organisation, 2020). Now, as of 2024, the Global warming rate is very high and more amounts of lethal radiations are getting through the Earth’s Ozone layer, which are detrimental to our health. The air is too polluted now, especially with industrial waste that people are scared to do their routine reps of “breathe-in, breathe-out” lung exercise. There aren’t more trees like before anymore to give us good air as they’re being cut down every day so the lands can be used for industrial and commercial purposes. Too much chemicals and fertilizers are used to grow crops to give enormous fruit and crop growth; we eat these foods and get complications due to these chemicals.We drink too much alcohol, use cigarettes and take in hard drugs. Now due to the fact that many sexually active men and women want to last longer in bed and impress their partners, they use sexually enhancing drugs or aphrodisiacs like Viagra and Dragon Spray, which are all sure tickets to kidney failure and Liver damage. We take in too much fats, oils and sugar by consuming junk foods and fast foods; our livers can’t bear the load of neutralizing the effects of our unhealthy dieting habits. What’s worse, we don’t eat on time; someone out there is taking in a whole pizza at 11:30 pm and will sleep right after eating. It’s like we don’t care for our bodies and the effects and complications like Stroke, Cancers, heart diseases, kidney complications and liver problems show up at age 15, 18, 25, 30, and subsequently cause early and rapid deaths.Now, we are more exposed to radiation from electronic devices like never before – millions use phones and computers each day, don’t they? There’s too much noise everywhere. Social media is causing insecurities leading to depression to people most of the time; they’d now commit suicide because the environment around us now and everything it presents to us is very much depressing.We have polluted our water bodies with industrial waste and plastics, and through illegal mining, and we end up using heavy metals to treat the water for consumption; we take in this seemingly “treated water” and end up hurting our kidneys due to heavy metals used in water treatment.We be on our mobile devices late at night, spend half of the night overthinking and having unproductive convos, ending up not sleeping early. Didn’t the Doctors advice that we have 8 undistracted hours of sleep each day? We rather have 3 to 5 hours of sleep which subsequently affects our health as it has been reported that poor sleep patterns equated to poor health, then shortened life span (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022).Now, we see exercising as a waste of time; we would rather eat (the junks), sleep, sleep, eat, repeat. Sadly, most people who exercise or workout don’t do so for the sake of the heart. Most gym lovers workout to build the glutes, biceps, abs and thighs instead of making sure the heart is smiling widely inside their chests. What Can the Youth Do Now?Unfortunately, with the growing rates of the environmental issues, coupled with people’s alarming addictions to unhealthy lifestyle, the lifespan of humans might as well be reduced to 50 years. But, little steps compound to cover a thousand-mile journey. That means there’s still chance for the Youth to live long by taking small steps to good health daily (I recommend you read these two books at this point: ‘Atomic Habits’ by James Clear, and ‘Fit Forever: One-a-day Devotionals for Body, Mind and Spirit’ by Kay Kuzma). For this to be achieved, the youth can: reduce screen time, eat more fruits and veggies and reduce the junks, do more cardio exercises for good heart health; desist totally from alcohol use and smoking, have time for meditations which can relieve them of psychological stress, sleep on time, shouldn’t abuse medical prescriptions and perform good personal hygiene practices. Final ThoughtsI believe strongly in living healthily but one thing’s for sure, we will leave this world behind and besides, we can’t be too careful because what you thought won’t matter might be the cause of your death (the movie, Final Destination made me realize this). As Avicii (R.I.P to him) said in his song “The Nights”, “He said one day you’ll live this world behind, so live a life you will remember…”, life is to be lived to the fullest. Many think living life fully means having tons of sex, boozing, partying, smoking, eating burgers and sugars every day, but that’s not the case at all. It rather involves smiling more, spending time with the people you love, travelling around the world, eating well, having positive mindset and doing the “healthy” things you love; all contributing to good health one way or another, increasing lifespan. Living healthily can save you from organ complications and save you from early deaths. Good life is healthy life; good life is a life lived well; good life is an everyday thing. So, stay healthy, stay safe, live life well and stay alive.

234,Part 1: Biological Operators ~ Genomic-Level Perturbations and Their Downstream Effects in Transcription,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Freedom Preetham Follow Meta Multiomics -- Listen Share Nature is modular and multi-scale. While natural systems exhibit chaos and complexity in the codomain with high variability, the natural phenomena itself can be captured by countably finite foundational operators. Getting lost in the variability and chaos of the range and codomain is not much helpful when capturing governing functions. Understanding the nuanced impact of genomic aberrations is essential for unraveling the complexities of gene expression and regulation. The beauty of genomics lies in the fact that almost every change must pass through transcription processes before exerting any downstream effects. By thoroughly understanding foundational aspects of transcription dynamics, such as gene expression, RNA splicing, 5' capping, polyadenylation, transcription regulation, and ribosome profiling, we can cover a broad base for comprehending how aberrations affect downstream molecular machinery. Each of this can be considered a foundational biological operator. This does not have to be innumerable operators. Biology can be considered as infinite variations of dynamic state of the foundational operators. In this article, I provide a framework (among many) for thinking through various genomic perturbations and their downstream consequences, emphasizing how a few well-designed assays based on the foundational biological operator can capture the broadest effects and offer comprehensive insights into genomic regulation. Series I use the term “Biological Operator” with both humility and a significant influence from the mathematical and physical sciences’ use of “operator.” This shift in perspective is necessary to address two critical points. First, in my opinion, there is a prevalent notion in biology that capturing the underlying dynamics requires consideration of an overwhelming number of variables. This perception may not be entirely accurate. While the state space in biological systems may exhibit infinite dynamics, these can often be described by a countably finite number of operators at a given scale. These operators can effectively capture the infinite variabilities of the system. (Activities in the transcription layer from genome to isoform is an example of a scale). Second, at a later stage in this series, I will demonstrate how to mathematically model biological operators as function-to-function mappings. This approach aligns with the true essence of operators in mathematics and physics. Promoter Mutations:Promoter regions are critical for the precise initiation of transcription, serving as docking sites for RNA polymerase II and an array of transcription factors (TFs). Mutations within promoter sequences can significantly alter the binding affinity and specificity of these TFs, thus modulating transcription initiation rates. For instance, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the TATA box or other core promoter elements can decrease TF binding affinity, leading to reduced transcriptional activity. Conversely, gain-of-function mutations can enhance TF binding, resulting in aberrant overexpression of target genes, a hallmark of oncogenic transformations. Enhancer Mutations:Enhancers are distal cis-regulatory elements that augment the transcription of target genes through the formation of DNA loops, bringing enhancers into close proximity with promoters. Mutations within enhancer sequences can disrupt these critical enhancer-promoter interactions, thereby diminishing transcriptional activation. Given the modular and tissue-specific nature of enhancers, such mutations can have pleiotropic effects, altering the expression of multiple genes within a regulatory network. Polyadenylation Signal Mutations:The polyadenylation signal (PAS), typically characterized by the hexamer sequence AAUAAA, is essential for the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA, leading to the addition of a poly(A) tail. Mutations within the PAS can impede proper cleavage and polyadenylation, resulting in unstable or improperly processed mRNA transcripts. This can markedly reduce mRNA half-life and translation efficiency, as seen in diseases like β-thalassemia, where a single nucleotide mutation in the PAS leads to ineffective mRNA maturation and reduced hemoglobin synthesis. microRNA Binding Site Mutations:microRNAs (miRNAs) are key post-transcriptional regulators that bind to complementary sequences within the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression. Mutations in miRNA binding sites can abrogate these interactions, resulting in dysregulated gene expression. For instance, mutations in the 3' UTR of the KRAS oncogene can prevent miRNA binding, thereby stabilizing the mRNA and enhancing translation, which contributes to tumorigenesis. Synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs): Synonymous SNPs, while not altering the amino acid sequence of proteins, can have significant regulatory effects at the molecular level. These mutations can impact mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and splicing by altering codon usage and mRNA secondary structures. Codon bias introduced by synonymous SNPs can affect translation kinetics, leading to variations in protein folding and function. Additionally, these SNPs can modulate the binding affinity of regulatory proteins or miRNAs to the mRNA, affecting post-transcriptional regulation and mRNA decay rates. Missense SNPs: Missense SNPs result in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein product. This alteration can have a range of effects depending on the properties of the amino acids involved and their position within the protein. Such mutations can: Nonsense SNPs: Nonsense SNPs introduce a premature stop codon in the coding sequence, leading to the production of truncated proteins. These incomplete proteins are usually nonfunctional and can: Regulatory SNPs: Non-coding SNPs occur outside of protein-coding regions but can influence gene expression and regulation. These include SNPs in: DNA Methylation and Histone Modifications:Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and various histone modifications, play pivotal roles in chromatin architecture and gene accessibility. DNA methylation typically occurs at CpG islands within promoter regions, leading to transcriptional repression through chromatin condensation. Histone modifications, such as methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation, can either activate or repress transcription depending on the specific modification and context. Aberrant epigenetic modifications are often associated with cancers and other diseases, exemplified by hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters leading to their silencing. Translocations, Inversions, and Deletions:Chromosomal rearrangements, including translocations, inversions, and deletions, can profoundly impact gene function and regulation. Such structural alterations can disrupt coding sequences or regulatory elements, or alter the three-dimensional genome organization. For example, the BCR-ABL fusion gene, resulting from a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (the Philadelphia chromosome), leads to constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and chronic myeloid leukemia. Duplications or Deletions of Genomic Segments:Copy number variations (CNVs) involve the duplication or deletion of large genomic segments, significantly affecting gene dosage. For instance, duplication of the MYC oncogene is frequently observed in cancers, leading to its overexpression and uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Conversely, deletions encompassing tumor suppressor genes, such as PTEN or TP53, can lead to haploinsufficiency and contribute to tumorigenesis. Transposable Element Insertions:Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements capable of inserting themselves into various genomic loci, thereby disrupting gene function or regulation. Insertions of TEs within coding regions can lead to frameshift mutations, while insertions in regulatory regions can alter gene expression. The insertion of a TE in the APC gene disrupts its function, leading to familial adenomatous polyposis, a condition predisposing individuals to colorectal cancer. Repeat Expansion Mutations:Repeat expansion mutations involve the abnormal increase in the number of tandem repeats of short DNA sequences. Such expansions can interfere with normal gene function through mechanisms like gene silencing, RNA toxicity, or protein aggregation. These mutations are implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington’s disease, where CAG repeat expansions in the HTT gene lead to toxic protein aggregates. The result of all the stated aberrations are some form of transcription affects. The biological operators can be attuned to “keeping an eye” on the transcriptional changes to makes sense of what may happen during translation. The downstream transcription effects due to the stated aberrations are as follows: Gene Expression:Gene expression encompasses the entire process of transcribing DNA into RNA and translating RNA into proteins. Genomic aberrations can impact gene expression at multiple levels: Transcription Factor Binding:Mutations that alter TF binding sites can affect the rate and fidelity of transcription. Enhanced or diminished TF binding can lead to inappropriate levels of gene expression, contributing to pathological conditions like cancer and genetic disorders. Chromatin Structure:Epigenetic modifications influence chromatin accessibility, significantly impacting transcriptional regulation. Open chromatin regions are generally associated with active transcription, while condensed chromatin regions are repressive. DNA Sequence:Direct mutations within the DNA sequence can alter transcription rates and accuracy, impacting mRNA production and subsequent protein synthesis. RNA Splicing:Mutations in splice sites or splicing regulatory elements can disrupt the splicing process, leading to the production of aberrant mRNA isoforms. For instance, mutations that create or abolish splice sites can result in exon skipping or the inclusion of intronic sequences, producing non-functional proteins or triggering nonsense-mediated decay. mRNA Stability:Changes in polyadenylation signals and miRNA binding sites can significantly impact mRNA stability and localization. These alterations influence the availability of mRNA for translation, thereby affecting protein synthesis and cellular function. The question now is to choose the smallest number of assays types to capture the broadest effects caused by genomic aberrations, several key assays are particularly effective: RNA-Seq: RNA-Seq provides a comprehensive view of mRNA abundance, splicing patterns, and allele-specific expression. This high-throughput sequencing technology can identify differential gene expression, detect alternative splicing events, and measure the relative expression of alleles, making it an invaluable tool for studying the impacts of genomic perturbations. Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE): CAGE maps transcription start sites (TSSs) and quantifies their usage, providing insights into promoter activity and alternative TSS selection. This assay can reveal shifts in TSS usage caused by mutations near TSS regions and measure changes in promoter activity, offering a detailed view of transcriptional regulation and its disruption by genomic mutations. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP): Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using Sequencing (ATAC-Seq) / DNase I Hypersensitive Sites Sequencing (DNase-Seq): These assays identify regions of open chromatin, providing a global view of chromatin accessibility. Changes in chromatin structure detected by these assays can indicate how mutations and epigenetic modifications alter chromatin states, affecting transcriptional regulation. Ribosome Profiling: Ribosome profiling provides a snapshot of active translation by mapping ribosome positions on mRNA. This technique allows researchers to study translation dynamics, identify which mRNAs are being actively translated, and detect changes in translation efficiency caused by genomic aberrations. Ribosome profiling is crucial for understanding how mutations affect the final stage of gene expression. The future of research into genomic transcription and isoforms lies in probably understanding biological operators and capturing them as governing functions through mathematical operators. The underlying phenomena can be effectively captured by a countably finite set of foundational operators. The key is to choose the smallest number of assay types to capture the broadest effects caused by genomic aberrations. By integrating high-throughput sequencing technologies like RNA-Seq, CAGE, and ribosome profiling with advanced computational models, we can accurately map how genomic aberrations influence transcription dynamics and isoform diversity. These foundational biological operators provide a framework for understanding the intricate dynamics of gene regulation. Single-cell sequencing will offer insights into cell-specific transcriptional variations and alternative splicing events, while CRISPR/Cas9 and other gene-editing tools will allow us to experimentally validate the roles of specific SNPs and regulatory elements. Ultimately, by focusing on capturing the governing functions of biological operators, we can achieve a deeper understanding of how transcriptional regulation and isoform generation contribute to cellular function and disease. This approach will possibly pave the way for targeted therapeutic strategies and precision medicine, advancing our grasp of genetic regulation and its implications for human health. -- -- Meta Multiomics AI Research | Math | Genomics | Quantum Physics Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "

237,Part 2: Biological Operators ~ Capturing the Effects of Synonymous SNPs Using Genomic Assays,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Freedom Preetham Follow Meta Multiomics -- Listen Share Understanding the nuanced impact of genomic aberrations is essential for unraveling the complexities of gene expression and regulation. The beauty of genomics lies in the fact that almost every change must pass through transcription processes before exerting any downstream effects. By thoroughly understanding foundational aspects of transcription dynamics, such as gene expression, RNA splicing, 5' capping, polyadenylation, transcription regulation, and ribosome profiling, we can cover a broad base for comprehending how aberrations affect downstream molecular machinery. Each of these can be considered a foundational biological operator, capturing the essential dynamics of the system. In this section, we will explore how specific genomic assays can be employed to capture the broad effects caused by synonymous SNPs. Synonymous SNPs, while not altering the amino acid sequence of proteins, can have significant regulatory effects at the molecular level. These mutations can impact mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and splicing by altering codon usage and mRNA secondary structures. Here’s how various assays can capture these impacts effectively: Series Synonymous SNPs do not change the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein but can have significant effects on gene expression and regulation. This is a key observation. These mutations can influence various molecular processes, from transcription initiation to translation dynamics. To understand these effects comprehensively, various genomic assays are employed. Here’s how each assay can be used to capture the impacts of synonymous SNPs: Usage: RNA-Seq provides a comprehensive overview of gene expression levels and alternative splicing patterns. It is particularly useful for detecting changes in mRNA abundance and isoform diversity that may result from synonymous SNPs. Ref: https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-019-5533-4 Capturing Effects: Usage: CAGE maps transcription start sites (TSSs) and measures their usage. This assay can reveal changes in promoter activity and alternative TSS selection. Capturing Effects: ChIP-Seq for Transcription Factors (ChIP-TF) Usage: ChIP-TF identifies the binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) across the genome, providing insights into transcriptional regulation. Capturing Effects: ChIP-Seq for Histone Modifications (ChIP-Histone) Usage: ChIP-Histone maps the distribution of histone modifications, revealing changes in chromatin state. Capturing Effects: Usage: These assays identify regions of open chromatin, providing a global view of chromatin accessibility. Capturing Effects: Usage: Ribosome profiling provides a snapshot of active translation by mapping ribosome positions on mRNA. Ref: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10450169/ Capturing Effects: By combining data from these various assays, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of how synonymous SNPs affect gene expression and regulation. For example: Understanding the effects of synonymous SNPs requires a multifaceted approach that leverages various genomic assays. By employing RNA-Seq, CAGE, ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq/DNase-Seq, and ribosome profiling, researchers can uncover the diverse ways in which these seemingly silent mutations impact gene expression, mRNA processing, chromatin structure, and translation dynamics. This comprehensive analysis is crucial for elucidating the regulatory roles of synonymous SNPs and their contributions to phenotypic variation and disease. Looking ahead, the integration of these technologies with advanced computational models and single-cell sequencing techniques will further refine our understanding of how synonymous SNPs and other genomic perturbations influence cellular function. These insights pave the way for developing targeted therapeutic strategies and advancing our grasp of genetic regulation and expression, ultimately contributing to precision medicine and personalized healthcare. Continued research in this area promises to unlock new dimensions in the study of gene regulation and its implications for human health and disease. -- -- Meta Multiomics AI Research | Math | Genomics | Quantum Physics Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "
238,Process Medicine: Who Do We Fight When We Fight Disease?,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Paddy Cashman Follow Original Philosophy -- 14 Listen Share *The following is not medical advice and I do not purport to write on behalf of all those living with chronic illness. Its commonplace to see headlines in the news about someone ‘losing their fight with cancer’. On reflection the choice of language is both strange and revealing, and not just because it labels sufferers losers posthumously. In a sense our bodies engage in a kind of fight against viral infections. But using this as the primary metaphor for responding to chronic illness may be psychologically demoralising and therapeutically limiting. It relies on assumptions that go to the heart of western — and increasingly global — culture’s most sacrosanct beliefs. Mechanistic medicine treats the body as a mechanised assemblage of discreet parts, rather than as a developmental organism. In a sense the machine metaphor is so easily dispensed with that its staying power is surprising — machines are artificially made, not grown. The organic world just does not consist of machines. Yet, since the time of Rene Descartes the machine metaphor has reigned supreme. Cartesian dualism objectified all but mind and God as res extensa — essentially inanimate matter extended in space. It didn’t take long for mechanistic materialism to render theism absurd, and for it to colonise the special status Descartes reserved for human minds. Paradoxically, despite this reduction of mind to matter, i.e measurable neural activity, the belief in humanity’s privileged status as somehow separate from nature, has persisted as an implicit assumption, albeit usually an unconscious one. The tradition of physics that followed Newton reinforced notions of a world constructed from the bottom-up by discreet material bits which dart around space deterministically, according to universal laws. This view of the world is underpinned by an empirical approach we might call quantitative positivism, where only that which can be quantitatively measured (hence discreetness) matters for our understanding of reality. The misrepresentation of these metaphysical and ontological presuppositions as empirical fact had the effect of maligning philosophical objections to the doctrine as subjective sophistry, thereby insulating mechanistic materialism as irreproachable doctrine, perhaps most enduringly so in bio-medicine. So compelling is this worldview that it has resisted a number of devastating challenges. Ironically, the first notable challenge came from Newton himself, when properly understood. Newton was dumbfounded by his findings about gravity and planetary motion, and for a good reason. Immaterial, planetary action at a distance totally undermined the common-sensical view of material bodies which act on eachother via direct contact. Gravitational action at a distance abolished Descartes’ res extensa, demonstrating, as Noam Chomsky argues, that “the world just isn’t a machine”*. In the 1920s, quantum mechanics revealed that what appear to us as discreet particles of matter, exist before measurement as mere probability. The arguments around determinism are complex, but at the very least this showed that we have no good reason to assume the universe is deterministic, as well as presenting strong evidence to the contrary. Despite this, deterministic, mechanistic materialism has remained dominant for centuries, partly because of how profitable it has been for economic development, scientific knowledge, and technological progress. But its stubborn staying power has a dark side, including when it comes to ‘non-communicable’ disease, the deaths from which are forecast to increase by almost 90% by 2050*. The tradition of process philosophy is a direct challenge to the clockwork universe of mechanistic materialism, and evolved in an attempt to properly integrate the findings of quantum physics. Quantum mechanics understands particles not just as atomic bits, but also as waves of probability. Waves are by definition processes unfolding through time, not discreet objects. Process thinkers reconceive of the whole of nature, not just the quantum domain, as a federation of hierarchically nested and open-ended processes. John Cobb Jr. described how ecosystems, understood in process terms, are comprised of communities of communities. Abandoning determinism renders humans creative, free-will agents embedded within these ecological communities, and indeed human beings are construed as ‘highly integrated ecosystems’. The human ecosystem is also constituted by sub-processes; organs and sub-systems, themselves constituted by tissues, tissues by cells, and so on, with each smaller, shorter duration process nested within the greater, longer duration processes. Its important to clarify that a process perspective on our bodies is not the same as saying our parts get slowly added over time until adulthood, at which point they gradually degrade. Its not just that our bodies are subject to the processes of entropy and change, but also that our bodies themselves are processes, or integrated sets of processes, to put a finer point on it. So even though we may experience relative developmental stability, and develop resilience to perturbations, we never achieve actual stasis. Our tissues constantly break down and renew, our cells constantly repair and replenish. Change is the only constant, as the old adage goes. If our bodies are processes, situated in larger processes and constituted by smaller ones, different questions and different answers arise when it comes to chronic illness. Process implies past and future poles, and because growth and change are constants in the human lifetime the future pole is open-ended, making some measure of healing a tangible possibility (as distinct from a cure, and relative always to what is achievable in an individual’s unique circumstances). Similarly, our past development was open-ended; things could have unfolded differently. Or, put another way, DNA isn’t destiny (except perhaps in cases of totally genetic disease). Incidentally, the way genetic factors of diseases are discussed is often disempowering. Those who undergo genetic testing may be told that they have ‘the gene for [disease x]’, as if this alone could account for their illness. In reality, notwithstanding the rare exceptions mentioned, genes simply predispose a person, often marginally so, to given conditions. It usually takes a perfect storm of toxic environmental factors and sustained psycho-physical (and therefore neural and immunological) dysregulation to move from predisposition to disease onset. Its also great PR for universities or research institutes to put out a press statement proclaiming they ‘found the gene that causes heart disease’, for example, so perverse media incentives also reinforce this genetic fatalism. In his recent book, The Myth of Normal, Dr Gabor Maté makes the case that illness too is better understood as a process, not as a thing. A medicine of process, as opposed to mechanistic medicine, would directly challenge the naïve belief that there is a healthy course of development we expect every person to undergo. Rates of illness, physical and psychological, show how delusional this belief is. Nonetheless, illness is dominantly treated as an aberration rather than a normal, logical outcome of human development corrupted by non-optimal interactions, endogenous and exogenous. Illness and trauma are reconceived as such in the The Myth of Normal. The common view, of illness as an unnatural aberration, evokes allusions to infectious diseases, where some exogenous agent enters into and meddles with the idealised human machine — a biological spanner in the works. For this reason diagnoses, which can be hugely affirming for sufferers, can also have unintended consequences. Those living with chronic illness learn to relate to disease possessively: “I have multiple sclerosis”, “She has cancer”. More than a quirk of language, possessive pathology locks patients into combat with their disease. Illness becomes the mugger in a dark alley, an adversary, who, if we just summoned enough gusto, we could vanquish through some herculean crusade. As someone living through chronic illness myself I’m sympathetic to such responses; they represent a natural defence mechanism, and they confer a sense of control in the short-term, but they’re also seriously limiting. This possessive conception of illness works in conjunction with the machine metaphor to engender a kind of nihilistic fatalism. If our bodies are machines which ‘have’ a disease inside them, unless there exists a perfect cure which can destroy or expel this intruder, as in the case of simple infections, we fight an impossible fight, with symptomatic relief the only balm. Indeed modern medicine’s approach to chronic illness is almost entirely constituted by symptom management, even moreso than is immediately obvious. Take autoimmune disease, where the immune system, as a result a confluence of factors, learns to treat the body’s own tissues as a threat. In rheumatoid arthritis the immune system treats the tissue in joints as a threat, and attacks accordingly. Symptoms arise as a result of this immune-mediated assault. Its uncontroversial that when inflamed joints cause pain, pain relief represents a symptomatic intervention, and a vital one to be clear. What may be less obvious is that immunosuppressive treatments are also symptomatic in a very real sense. This is because a dysfunctional immune system, like any system of the body, cannot be fully understood in isolation. The evidence doesn’t support immune overactivation being at the start of the aetiological chain of causation. Furthermore, thinking in terms of an idealised chain of linear causation may be grossly simplistic when it comes to human health. Among process thinkers, organisms are sometimes referred to as ‘highly integrated ecosystems’, highlighting the complexly interacting subsystems which compose us. This suggests that the development of disease must involve a diversity of multilateral causes. In accordance with Cobb’s notion of communities of communities, process philosopher Arran Gare defined health in this way: “Health is characterized by mutual augmenting of the whole community and the component communities of each other, facilitating their continued successful functioning, their resilience in response to perturbations, new situations and stress, and for ongoing development and creativity to maximize developmental options, and can be measured as such.”* If health cannot be achieved by one community in isolation from those around it, or from those which compose it, then nor can the dysfunction of one system be understood in isolation from its environmental context. From this perspective defining autoimmune illness as an ‘overactive immune system’ is lazy, shoddy aetiology. This is not to mention the risks of solely symptomatic treatment, which targets bodily systems in a compartmentalised manner. Under a mechanistic framework this typically means drug use, as in the case of depression. Mechanistic medicine reduces depression to a deficiency of dopamine (or other ‘feel-good’ hormones). The neuroscience behind this reductionism is fascinating and instructive. Psychiatrist Iain McGilchrist adds a new dimension to the historical development of mechanistic materialism, by incorporating research on the brain’s hemispheres. In The Master and His Emissary, McGilchrist shows how mechanistic-materialistic thinking is lopsidedly left-brained, and how, since the Enlightenment, the hemispheric pendulum has swung further and further left. Though both hemispheres have their virtues, McGilchrist calls for a balanced integration of the two. The left hemisphere deals in reductionism, not holism; things, not processes; certainty, not uncertainty. It reduces complex problems to causative factors which it can quantify and understand mechanistically. Where there are lower serum levels of a hormone, this defines a condition. In such a case, an easy solution materialises: artificially offset the chemical deficit, and viola! All of this is done without attention to the broader causative matrix — psychological, social, economic, and ecological — which enables wellbeing. As Alexandra Brewis put it regarding current approaches to the obesity: “Obesity is a complex, multi-faceted, deep-rooted part of the contemporary human condition that resists simple, singular, quick, or easy fixes. Because it has stemmed from fundamental social, economic, and ecological changes our species has faced over the last few decades, only sustained and fundamental examination of those conditions is likely to do much about it.”* If instead we continue taking the standard view, we risk treating metrics rather than people; symptoms rather than underlying causes. A myopic focus on metrics in a narrow set of domains, the quantitative positivism characteristic of the left hemisphere, leads us to neglect approaches that foster long-term, holistic (i.e not system-specific) health. Again, symptomatic relief is essential but when it dominates our therapeutic approach we risk leaving the broader network of processes that compose health to atrophy. If I don’t take medication every day I can’t walk around without debilitating pain. But when medication is my only strategy I’m multitudes worse when it comes to brain fog, mood, energy, gut health, sleep, fitness, inflammation, brain health, and nutrition. Which is absolutely fine if you reduce chronic healthcare to narrow symptom management, but terrible if you want to foster long-term health and enjoy your life. The burgeoning field of functional medicine is leading the way when it comes to treating people more holistically. Functional medicine shows a greater appreciation for the complex interactions between different bodily systems, interactions research in psycho-neuro-immunology catalogues.* Pioneering research into the therapeutic value of diet and lifestyle for disease shows how transformative these factors can be, as a return to health in one bodily system produces cascading benefits across others. There is growing recognition of exactly this when it comes to the role of gut health. At least 70% of our immune cells reside in our gut, and the vagus nerve connecting the gut to the brain means inflammation in the gut mediates neural inflammation, which, if chronic, mediates mental illness* and many other diseases.* Whereas a mechanistic, metric-treating approach would have us treat high markers of inflammation with anti-inflammatories, a functional medicine approach like that advocated for by Michael Ruscio in his book Healthy Gut Healthy You opens up gut-focussed options. It turns out probiotics can help repair gut dysbiosis, reduce inflammation, and thereby aid in the treatment of depression.* Of course, I’m not denying that many doctors understand these complexities, and some convey them to patients. Unfortunately my experience, as with many experiencing chronic health issues, is that information about holistic approaches is virtually never volunteered by specialists when discussing diagnosis and treatment. Despite so much high-quality, peer-reviewed research challenging the mechanistic paradigm, it still dominates the language of practitioners and patients. It continues to constrain healthcare research and practice within its ideological bounds. This means fatalistic framing and solely symptomatic strategies are still the norm. I’ve tried to convey how the perspectives of human ecology and process philosophy take us beyond anthropocentrism. Integrating ideas from deep ecology re-embeds humans within the organic world — challenging a dualism which emancipates us from the planet’s ecology. Therefore not only is dysfunction in one system of the body a product of the entire body being out of balance, but more broadly an unhealthy person must be understood as the product of an unhealthy culture; of a polluted environment for example. Just as cells in the environment of one Petri dish (literally a culture) may thrive, whilst those in another may flounder, so do we all depend on the communities we’re embedded in for our wellbeing. If so, chronic illness is a necessary outcome - not an aberration - of people whose own processes, but also those they live within, have become extremely dysregulated. People for whom complex feedback between dysfunctional biological, psychological, environmental, and social activity entrenches chronic dysfunction in the body. Much of this dysfunction begins in adaptive strategies, but then persists past the point of usefulness and starts doing harm. A young child learns to repress her negative emotions to protect her stressed mother, but in adulthood the chronic stress this causes dysregulates the immune system, predisposing her to illness, as Maté argues. An immune cell correctly identifies a chemical compound as threatening, but later registers a molecularly analogous bodily tissue as a threat, and attacks, as is theorised to occur in autoimmune conditions.* What was initially adaptive becomes maladaptive, and corrupts bodily processes. Process philosophers have referred to such perversities as semiotic corruption.* * This shift in perspective is not academic. If illness is in fact a process patients undergo, rather than an intruder they must exorcise, the ‘fighting disease’ approach is properly understood as a philosophy of self-harm. After all, as someone living with symptoms likely caused by brain lesions inflicted by my own immune system, what am I to fight? My own brain? Should I don the gloves and give my immune system the old one-two? How does this macho attitude help us confront and deal with the major life stressors that up to 80% of autoimmune sufferers report experiencing just before the onset of their illness?* * Or the contributing inflammatory and leaky gut issues which appear causative?* * As Mary Midgley points out*, metaphors aren’t arbitrary, they’re revealing. In this case the machine metaphor reveals how we conceive of chronic illness as a deviation from perfect mechanistic function, and how a process of ideological gatekeeping determines which explanations and remedies are legitimated, and which are not. Going beyond mechanistic materialism means leaving behind its attendant atomistic individualism too. Hence its necessary but insufficient to recognise, for example, that studies have linked emotional repression with disease risk (here’s one particularly striking one). Or that adverse experiences in an individual’s infancy predispose them to disease*. Under a more collectivist and top down viewpoint, we’re compelled to ask just what it is about our extractivist and parasitic economic system that engenders so much stress and toxicity. When we fail so consistently to meet people’s most basic human needs, why should we expect healthy development? A process worldview doesn’t have all the answers, but unless we start taking some of these questions seriously we are truly on a road to nowhere. Going beyond the mechanistic paradigm in medicine, notwithstanding all the benefits it has conferred, would bring these questions to the fore, and offer a less constrictive language with which to relate to disease. This doesn’t mean denying the utility of bottom-up analysis and mechanistic thinking, but it does mean becoming more pluralistic, appreciating top-down, process, and holistic thinking for their virtues. For stalwarts of the entrenched paradigm such a shift may prove too destabilising. Easier to speak of machines and their broken bits. Easier, but deadlier. -- -- 14 Original Philosophy Amateurish polymath. Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "
239,Part 1: Biological Operators ~ Genomic-Level Perturbations and Their Downstream Effects in Transcription,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Freedom Preetham Follow Meta Multiomics -- Listen Share Nature is modular and multi-scale. While natural systems exhibit chaos and complexity in the codomain with high variability, the natural phenomena itself can be captured by countably finite foundational operators. Getting lost in the variability and chaos of the range and codomain is not much helpful when capturing governing functions. Understanding the nuanced impact of genomic aberrations is essential for unraveling the complexities of gene expression and regulation. The beauty of genomics lies in the fact that almost every change must pass through transcription processes before exerting any downstream effects. By thoroughly understanding foundational aspects of transcription dynamics, such as gene expression, RNA splicing, 5' capping, polyadenylation, transcription regulation, and ribosome profiling, we can cover a broad base for comprehending how aberrations affect downstream molecular machinery. Each of this can be considered a foundational biological operator. This does not have to be innumerable operators. Biology can be considered as infinite variations of dynamic state of the foundational operators. In this article, I provide a framework (among many) for thinking through various genomic perturbations and their downstream consequences, emphasizing how a few well-designed assays based on the foundational biological operator can capture the broadest effects and offer comprehensive insights into genomic regulation. Series I use the term “Biological Operator” with both humility and a significant influence from the mathematical and physical sciences’ use of “operator.” This shift in perspective is necessary to address two critical points. First, in my opinion, there is a prevalent notion in biology that capturing the underlying dynamics requires consideration of an overwhelming number of variables. This perception may not be entirely accurate. While the state space in biological systems may exhibit infinite dynamics, these can often be described by a countably finite number of operators at a given scale. These operators can effectively capture the infinite variabilities of the system. (Activities in the transcription layer from genome to isoform is an example of a scale). Second, at a later stage in this series, I will demonstrate how to mathematically model biological operators as function-to-function mappings. This approach aligns with the true essence of operators in mathematics and physics. Promoter Mutations:Promoter regions are critical for the precise initiation of transcription, serving as docking sites for RNA polymerase II and an array of transcription factors (TFs). Mutations within promoter sequences can significantly alter the binding affinity and specificity of these TFs, thus modulating transcription initiation rates. For instance, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the TATA box or other core promoter elements can decrease TF binding affinity, leading to reduced transcriptional activity. Conversely, gain-of-function mutations can enhance TF binding, resulting in aberrant overexpression of target genes, a hallmark of oncogenic transformations. Enhancer Mutations:Enhancers are distal cis-regulatory elements that augment the transcription of target genes through the formation of DNA loops, bringing enhancers into close proximity with promoters. Mutations within enhancer sequences can disrupt these critical enhancer-promoter interactions, thereby diminishing transcriptional activation. Given the modular and tissue-specific nature of enhancers, such mutations can have pleiotropic effects, altering the expression of multiple genes within a regulatory network. Polyadenylation Signal Mutations:The polyadenylation signal (PAS), typically characterized by the hexamer sequence AAUAAA, is essential for the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA, leading to the addition of a poly(A) tail. Mutations within the PAS can impede proper cleavage and polyadenylation, resulting in unstable or improperly processed mRNA transcripts. This can markedly reduce mRNA half-life and translation efficiency, as seen in diseases like β-thalassemia, where a single nucleotide mutation in the PAS leads to ineffective mRNA maturation and reduced hemoglobin synthesis. microRNA Binding Site Mutations:microRNAs (miRNAs) are key post-transcriptional regulators that bind to complementary sequences within the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression. Mutations in miRNA binding sites can abrogate these interactions, resulting in dysregulated gene expression. For instance, mutations in the 3' UTR of the KRAS oncogene can prevent miRNA binding, thereby stabilizing the mRNA and enhancing translation, which contributes to tumorigenesis. Synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs): Synonymous SNPs, while not altering the amino acid sequence of proteins, can have significant regulatory effects at the molecular level. These mutations can impact mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and splicing by altering codon usage and mRNA secondary structures. Codon bias introduced by synonymous SNPs can affect translation kinetics, leading to variations in protein folding and function. Additionally, these SNPs can modulate the binding affinity of regulatory proteins or miRNAs to the mRNA, affecting post-transcriptional regulation and mRNA decay rates. Missense SNPs: Missense SNPs result in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein product. This alteration can have a range of effects depending on the properties of the amino acids involved and their position within the protein. Such mutations can: Nonsense SNPs: Nonsense SNPs introduce a premature stop codon in the coding sequence, leading to the production of truncated proteins. These incomplete proteins are usually nonfunctional and can: Regulatory SNPs: Non-coding SNPs occur outside of protein-coding regions but can influence gene expression and regulation. These include SNPs in: DNA Methylation and Histone Modifications:Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and various histone modifications, play pivotal roles in chromatin architecture and gene accessibility. DNA methylation typically occurs at CpG islands within promoter regions, leading to transcriptional repression through chromatin condensation. Histone modifications, such as methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation, can either activate or repress transcription depending on the specific modification and context. Aberrant epigenetic modifications are often associated with cancers and other diseases, exemplified by hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters leading to their silencing. Translocations, Inversions, and Deletions:Chromosomal rearrangements, including translocations, inversions, and deletions, can profoundly impact gene function and regulation. Such structural alterations can disrupt coding sequences or regulatory elements, or alter the three-dimensional genome organization. For example, the BCR-ABL fusion gene, resulting from a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (the Philadelphia chromosome), leads to constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and chronic myeloid leukemia. Duplications or Deletions of Genomic Segments:Copy number variations (CNVs) involve the duplication or deletion of large genomic segments, significantly affecting gene dosage. For instance, duplication of the MYC oncogene is frequently observed in cancers, leading to its overexpression and uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Conversely, deletions encompassing tumor suppressor genes, such as PTEN or TP53, can lead to haploinsufficiency and contribute to tumorigenesis. Transposable Element Insertions:Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements capable of inserting themselves into various genomic loci, thereby disrupting gene function or regulation. Insertions of TEs within coding regions can lead to frameshift mutations, while insertions in regulatory regions can alter gene expression. The insertion of a TE in the APC gene disrupts its function, leading to familial adenomatous polyposis, a condition predisposing individuals to colorectal cancer. Repeat Expansion Mutations:Repeat expansion mutations involve the abnormal increase in the number of tandem repeats of short DNA sequences. Such expansions can interfere with normal gene function through mechanisms like gene silencing, RNA toxicity, or protein aggregation. These mutations are implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington’s disease, where CAG repeat expansions in the HTT gene lead to toxic protein aggregates. The result of all the stated aberrations are some form of transcription affects. The biological operators can be attuned to “keeping an eye” on the transcriptional changes to makes sense of what may happen during translation. The downstream transcription effects due to the stated aberrations are as follows: Gene Expression:Gene expression encompasses the entire process of transcribing DNA into RNA and translating RNA into proteins. Genomic aberrations can impact gene expression at multiple levels: Transcription Factor Binding:Mutations that alter TF binding sites can affect the rate and fidelity of transcription. Enhanced or diminished TF binding can lead to inappropriate levels of gene expression, contributing to pathological conditions like cancer and genetic disorders. Chromatin Structure:Epigenetic modifications influence chromatin accessibility, significantly impacting transcriptional regulation. Open chromatin regions are generally associated with active transcription, while condensed chromatin regions are repressive. DNA Sequence:Direct mutations within the DNA sequence can alter transcription rates and accuracy, impacting mRNA production and subsequent protein synthesis. RNA Splicing:Mutations in splice sites or splicing regulatory elements can disrupt the splicing process, leading to the production of aberrant mRNA isoforms. For instance, mutations that create or abolish splice sites can result in exon skipping or the inclusion of intronic sequences, producing non-functional proteins or triggering nonsense-mediated decay. mRNA Stability:Changes in polyadenylation signals and miRNA binding sites can significantly impact mRNA stability and localization. These alterations influence the availability of mRNA for translation, thereby affecting protein synthesis and cellular function. The question now is to choose the smallest number of assays types to capture the broadest effects caused by genomic aberrations, several key assays are particularly effective: RNA-Seq: RNA-Seq provides a comprehensive view of mRNA abundance, splicing patterns, and allele-specific expression. This high-throughput sequencing technology can identify differential gene expression, detect alternative splicing events, and measure the relative expression of alleles, making it an invaluable tool for studying the impacts of genomic perturbations. Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE): CAGE maps transcription start sites (TSSs) and quantifies their usage, providing insights into promoter activity and alternative TSS selection. This assay can reveal shifts in TSS usage caused by mutations near TSS regions and measure changes in promoter activity, offering a detailed view of transcriptional regulation and its disruption by genomic mutations. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP): Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using Sequencing (ATAC-Seq) / DNase I Hypersensitive Sites Sequencing (DNase-Seq): These assays identify regions of open chromatin, providing a global view of chromatin accessibility. Changes in chromatin structure detected by these assays can indicate how mutations and epigenetic modifications alter chromatin states, affecting transcriptional regulation. Ribosome Profiling: Ribosome profiling provides a snapshot of active translation by mapping ribosome positions on mRNA. This technique allows researchers to study translation dynamics, identify which mRNAs are being actively translated, and detect changes in translation efficiency caused by genomic aberrations. Ribosome profiling is crucial for understanding how mutations affect the final stage of gene expression. The future of research into genomic transcription and isoforms lies in probably understanding biological operators and capturing them as governing functions through mathematical operators. The underlying phenomena can be effectively captured by a countably finite set of foundational operators. The key is to choose the smallest number of assay types to capture the broadest effects caused by genomic aberrations. By integrating high-throughput sequencing technologies like RNA-Seq, CAGE, and ribosome profiling with advanced computational models, we can accurately map how genomic aberrations influence transcription dynamics and isoform diversity. These foundational biological operators provide a framework for understanding the intricate dynamics of gene regulation. Single-cell sequencing will offer insights into cell-specific transcriptional variations and alternative splicing events, while CRISPR/Cas9 and other gene-editing tools will allow us to experimentally validate the roles of specific SNPs and regulatory elements. Ultimately, by focusing on capturing the governing functions of biological operators, we can achieve a deeper understanding of how transcriptional regulation and isoform generation contribute to cellular function and disease. This approach will possibly pave the way for targeted therapeutic strategies and precision medicine, advancing our grasp of genetic regulation and its implications for human health. -- -- Meta Multiomics AI Research | Math | Genomics | Quantum Physics Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "

242,Part 2: Biological Operators ~ Capturing the Effects of Synonymous SNPs Using Genomic Assays,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Freedom Preetham Follow Meta Multiomics -- Listen Share Understanding the nuanced impact of genomic aberrations is essential for unraveling the complexities of gene expression and regulation. The beauty of genomics lies in the fact that almost every change must pass through transcription processes before exerting any downstream effects. By thoroughly understanding foundational aspects of transcription dynamics, such as gene expression, RNA splicing, 5' capping, polyadenylation, transcription regulation, and ribosome profiling, we can cover a broad base for comprehending how aberrations affect downstream molecular machinery. Each of these can be considered a foundational biological operator, capturing the essential dynamics of the system. In this section, we will explore how specific genomic assays can be employed to capture the broad effects caused by synonymous SNPs. Synonymous SNPs, while not altering the amino acid sequence of proteins, can have significant regulatory effects at the molecular level. These mutations can impact mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and splicing by altering codon usage and mRNA secondary structures. Here’s how various assays can capture these impacts effectively: Series Synonymous SNPs do not change the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein but can have significant effects on gene expression and regulation. This is a key observation. These mutations can influence various molecular processes, from transcription initiation to translation dynamics. To understand these effects comprehensively, various genomic assays are employed. Here’s how each assay can be used to capture the impacts of synonymous SNPs: Usage: RNA-Seq provides a comprehensive overview of gene expression levels and alternative splicing patterns. It is particularly useful for detecting changes in mRNA abundance and isoform diversity that may result from synonymous SNPs. Ref: https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-019-5533-4 Capturing Effects: Usage: CAGE maps transcription start sites (TSSs) and measures their usage. This assay can reveal changes in promoter activity and alternative TSS selection. Capturing Effects: ChIP-Seq for Transcription Factors (ChIP-TF) Usage: ChIP-TF identifies the binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) across the genome, providing insights into transcriptional regulation. Capturing Effects: ChIP-Seq for Histone Modifications (ChIP-Histone) Usage: ChIP-Histone maps the distribution of histone modifications, revealing changes in chromatin state. Capturing Effects: Usage: These assays identify regions of open chromatin, providing a global view of chromatin accessibility. Capturing Effects: Usage: Ribosome profiling provides a snapshot of active translation by mapping ribosome positions on mRNA. Ref: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10450169/ Capturing Effects: By combining data from these various assays, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of how synonymous SNPs affect gene expression and regulation. For example: Understanding the effects of synonymous SNPs requires a multifaceted approach that leverages various genomic assays. By employing RNA-Seq, CAGE, ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq/DNase-Seq, and ribosome profiling, researchers can uncover the diverse ways in which these seemingly silent mutations impact gene expression, mRNA processing, chromatin structure, and translation dynamics. This comprehensive analysis is crucial for elucidating the regulatory roles of synonymous SNPs and their contributions to phenotypic variation and disease. Looking ahead, the integration of these technologies with advanced computational models and single-cell sequencing techniques will further refine our understanding of how synonymous SNPs and other genomic perturbations influence cellular function. These insights pave the way for developing targeted therapeutic strategies and advancing our grasp of genetic regulation and expression, ultimately contributing to precision medicine and personalized healthcare. Continued research in this area promises to unlock new dimensions in the study of gene regulation and its implications for human health and disease. -- -- Meta Multiomics AI Research | Math | Genomics | Quantum Physics Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "
243,Process Medicine: Who Do We Fight When We Fight Disease?,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Paddy Cashman Follow Original Philosophy -- 14 Listen Share *The following is not medical advice and I do not purport to write on behalf of all those living with chronic illness. Its commonplace to see headlines in the news about someone ‘losing their fight with cancer’. On reflection the choice of language is both strange and revealing, and not just because it labels sufferers losers posthumously. In a sense our bodies engage in a kind of fight against viral infections. But using this as the primary metaphor for responding to chronic illness may be psychologically demoralising and therapeutically limiting. It relies on assumptions that go to the heart of western — and increasingly global — culture’s most sacrosanct beliefs. Mechanistic medicine treats the body as a mechanised assemblage of discreet parts, rather than as a developmental organism. In a sense the machine metaphor is so easily dispensed with that its staying power is surprising — machines are artificially made, not grown. The organic world just does not consist of machines. Yet, since the time of Rene Descartes the machine metaphor has reigned supreme. Cartesian dualism objectified all but mind and God as res extensa — essentially inanimate matter extended in space. It didn’t take long for mechanistic materialism to render theism absurd, and for it to colonise the special status Descartes reserved for human minds. Paradoxically, despite this reduction of mind to matter, i.e measurable neural activity, the belief in humanity’s privileged status as somehow separate from nature, has persisted as an implicit assumption, albeit usually an unconscious one. The tradition of physics that followed Newton reinforced notions of a world constructed from the bottom-up by discreet material bits which dart around space deterministically, according to universal laws. This view of the world is underpinned by an empirical approach we might call quantitative positivism, where only that which can be quantitatively measured (hence discreetness) matters for our understanding of reality. The misrepresentation of these metaphysical and ontological presuppositions as empirical fact had the effect of maligning philosophical objections to the doctrine as subjective sophistry, thereby insulating mechanistic materialism as irreproachable doctrine, perhaps most enduringly so in bio-medicine. So compelling is this worldview that it has resisted a number of devastating challenges. Ironically, the first notable challenge came from Newton himself, when properly understood. Newton was dumbfounded by his findings about gravity and planetary motion, and for a good reason. Immaterial, planetary action at a distance totally undermined the common-sensical view of material bodies which act on eachother via direct contact. Gravitational action at a distance abolished Descartes’ res extensa, demonstrating, as Noam Chomsky argues, that “the world just isn’t a machine”*. In the 1920s, quantum mechanics revealed that what appear to us as discreet particles of matter, exist before measurement as mere probability. The arguments around determinism are complex, but at the very least this showed that we have no good reason to assume the universe is deterministic, as well as presenting strong evidence to the contrary. Despite this, deterministic, mechanistic materialism has remained dominant for centuries, partly because of how profitable it has been for economic development, scientific knowledge, and technological progress. But its stubborn staying power has a dark side, including when it comes to ‘non-communicable’ disease, the deaths from which are forecast to increase by almost 90% by 2050*. The tradition of process philosophy is a direct challenge to the clockwork universe of mechanistic materialism, and evolved in an attempt to properly integrate the findings of quantum physics. Quantum mechanics understands particles not just as atomic bits, but also as waves of probability. Waves are by definition processes unfolding through time, not discreet objects. Process thinkers reconceive of the whole of nature, not just the quantum domain, as a federation of hierarchically nested and open-ended processes. John Cobb Jr. described how ecosystems, understood in process terms, are comprised of communities of communities. Abandoning determinism renders humans creative, free-will agents embedded within these ecological communities, and indeed human beings are construed as ‘highly integrated ecosystems’. The human ecosystem is also constituted by sub-processes; organs and sub-systems, themselves constituted by tissues, tissues by cells, and so on, with each smaller, shorter duration process nested within the greater, longer duration processes. Its important to clarify that a process perspective on our bodies is not the same as saying our parts get slowly added over time until adulthood, at which point they gradually degrade. Its not just that our bodies are subject to the processes of entropy and change, but also that our bodies themselves are processes, or integrated sets of processes, to put a finer point on it. So even though we may experience relative developmental stability, and develop resilience to perturbations, we never achieve actual stasis. Our tissues constantly break down and renew, our cells constantly repair and replenish. Change is the only constant, as the old adage goes. If our bodies are processes, situated in larger processes and constituted by smaller ones, different questions and different answers arise when it comes to chronic illness. Process implies past and future poles, and because growth and change are constants in the human lifetime the future pole is open-ended, making some measure of healing a tangible possibility (as distinct from a cure, and relative always to what is achievable in an individual’s unique circumstances). Similarly, our past development was open-ended; things could have unfolded differently. Or, put another way, DNA isn’t destiny (except perhaps in cases of totally genetic disease). Incidentally, the way genetic factors of diseases are discussed is often disempowering. Those who undergo genetic testing may be told that they have ‘the gene for [disease x]’, as if this alone could account for their illness. In reality, notwithstanding the rare exceptions mentioned, genes simply predispose a person, often marginally so, to given conditions. It usually takes a perfect storm of toxic environmental factors and sustained psycho-physical (and therefore neural and immunological) dysregulation to move from predisposition to disease onset. Its also great PR for universities or research institutes to put out a press statement proclaiming they ‘found the gene that causes heart disease’, for example, so perverse media incentives also reinforce this genetic fatalism. In his recent book, The Myth of Normal, Dr Gabor Maté makes the case that illness too is better understood as a process, not as a thing. A medicine of process, as opposed to mechanistic medicine, would directly challenge the naïve belief that there is a healthy course of development we expect every person to undergo. Rates of illness, physical and psychological, show how delusional this belief is. Nonetheless, illness is dominantly treated as an aberration rather than a normal, logical outcome of human development corrupted by non-optimal interactions, endogenous and exogenous. Illness and trauma are reconceived as such in the The Myth of Normal. The common view, of illness as an unnatural aberration, evokes allusions to infectious diseases, where some exogenous agent enters into and meddles with the idealised human machine — a biological spanner in the works. For this reason diagnoses, which can be hugely affirming for sufferers, can also have unintended consequences. Those living with chronic illness learn to relate to disease possessively: “I have multiple sclerosis”, “She has cancer”. More than a quirk of language, possessive pathology locks patients into combat with their disease. Illness becomes the mugger in a dark alley, an adversary, who, if we just summoned enough gusto, we could vanquish through some herculean crusade. As someone living through chronic illness myself I’m sympathetic to such responses; they represent a natural defence mechanism, and they confer a sense of control in the short-term, but they’re also seriously limiting. This possessive conception of illness works in conjunction with the machine metaphor to engender a kind of nihilistic fatalism. If our bodies are machines which ‘have’ a disease inside them, unless there exists a perfect cure which can destroy or expel this intruder, as in the case of simple infections, we fight an impossible fight, with symptomatic relief the only balm. Indeed modern medicine’s approach to chronic illness is almost entirely constituted by symptom management, even moreso than is immediately obvious. Take autoimmune disease, where the immune system, as a result a confluence of factors, learns to treat the body’s own tissues as a threat. In rheumatoid arthritis the immune system treats the tissue in joints as a threat, and attacks accordingly. Symptoms arise as a result of this immune-mediated assault. Its uncontroversial that when inflamed joints cause pain, pain relief represents a symptomatic intervention, and a vital one to be clear. What may be less obvious is that immunosuppressive treatments are also symptomatic in a very real sense. This is because a dysfunctional immune system, like any system of the body, cannot be fully understood in isolation. The evidence doesn’t support immune overactivation being at the start of the aetiological chain of causation. Furthermore, thinking in terms of an idealised chain of linear causation may be grossly simplistic when it comes to human health. Among process thinkers, organisms are sometimes referred to as ‘highly integrated ecosystems’, highlighting the complexly interacting subsystems which compose us. This suggests that the development of disease must involve a diversity of multilateral causes. In accordance with Cobb’s notion of communities of communities, process philosopher Arran Gare defined health in this way: “Health is characterized by mutual augmenting of the whole community and the component communities of each other, facilitating their continued successful functioning, their resilience in response to perturbations, new situations and stress, and for ongoing development and creativity to maximize developmental options, and can be measured as such.”* If health cannot be achieved by one community in isolation from those around it, or from those which compose it, then nor can the dysfunction of one system be understood in isolation from its environmental context. From this perspective defining autoimmune illness as an ‘overactive immune system’ is lazy, shoddy aetiology. This is not to mention the risks of solely symptomatic treatment, which targets bodily systems in a compartmentalised manner. Under a mechanistic framework this typically means drug use, as in the case of depression. Mechanistic medicine reduces depression to a deficiency of dopamine (or other ‘feel-good’ hormones). The neuroscience behind this reductionism is fascinating and instructive. Psychiatrist Iain McGilchrist adds a new dimension to the historical development of mechanistic materialism, by incorporating research on the brain’s hemispheres. In The Master and His Emissary, McGilchrist shows how mechanistic-materialistic thinking is lopsidedly left-brained, and how, since the Enlightenment, the hemispheric pendulum has swung further and further left. Though both hemispheres have their virtues, McGilchrist calls for a balanced integration of the two. The left hemisphere deals in reductionism, not holism; things, not processes; certainty, not uncertainty. It reduces complex problems to causative factors which it can quantify and understand mechanistically. Where there are lower serum levels of a hormone, this defines a condition. In such a case, an easy solution materialises: artificially offset the chemical deficit, and viola! All of this is done without attention to the broader causative matrix — psychological, social, economic, and ecological — which enables wellbeing. As Alexandra Brewis put it regarding current approaches to the obesity: “Obesity is a complex, multi-faceted, deep-rooted part of the contemporary human condition that resists simple, singular, quick, or easy fixes. Because it has stemmed from fundamental social, economic, and ecological changes our species has faced over the last few decades, only sustained and fundamental examination of those conditions is likely to do much about it.”* If instead we continue taking the standard view, we risk treating metrics rather than people; symptoms rather than underlying causes. A myopic focus on metrics in a narrow set of domains, the quantitative positivism characteristic of the left hemisphere, leads us to neglect approaches that foster long-term, holistic (i.e not system-specific) health. Again, symptomatic relief is essential but when it dominates our therapeutic approach we risk leaving the broader network of processes that compose health to atrophy. If I don’t take medication every day I can’t walk around without debilitating pain. But when medication is my only strategy I’m multitudes worse when it comes to brain fog, mood, energy, gut health, sleep, fitness, inflammation, brain health, and nutrition. Which is absolutely fine if you reduce chronic healthcare to narrow symptom management, but terrible if you want to foster long-term health and enjoy your life. The burgeoning field of functional medicine is leading the way when it comes to treating people more holistically. Functional medicine shows a greater appreciation for the complex interactions between different bodily systems, interactions research in psycho-neuro-immunology catalogues.* Pioneering research into the therapeutic value of diet and lifestyle for disease shows how transformative these factors can be, as a return to health in one bodily system produces cascading benefits across others. There is growing recognition of exactly this when it comes to the role of gut health. At least 70% of our immune cells reside in our gut, and the vagus nerve connecting the gut to the brain means inflammation in the gut mediates neural inflammation, which, if chronic, mediates mental illness* and many other diseases.* Whereas a mechanistic, metric-treating approach would have us treat high markers of inflammation with anti-inflammatories, a functional medicine approach like that advocated for by Michael Ruscio in his book Healthy Gut Healthy You opens up gut-focussed options. It turns out probiotics can help repair gut dysbiosis, reduce inflammation, and thereby aid in the treatment of depression.* Of course, I’m not denying that many doctors understand these complexities, and some convey them to patients. Unfortunately my experience, as with many experiencing chronic health issues, is that information about holistic approaches is virtually never volunteered by specialists when discussing diagnosis and treatment. Despite so much high-quality, peer-reviewed research challenging the mechanistic paradigm, it still dominates the language of practitioners and patients. It continues to constrain healthcare research and practice within its ideological bounds. This means fatalistic framing and solely symptomatic strategies are still the norm. I’ve tried to convey how the perspectives of human ecology and process philosophy take us beyond anthropocentrism. Integrating ideas from deep ecology re-embeds humans within the organic world — challenging a dualism which emancipates us from the planet’s ecology. Therefore not only is dysfunction in one system of the body a product of the entire body being out of balance, but more broadly an unhealthy person must be understood as the product of an unhealthy culture; of a polluted environment for example. Just as cells in the environment of one Petri dish (literally a culture) may thrive, whilst those in another may flounder, so do we all depend on the communities we’re embedded in for our wellbeing. If so, chronic illness is a necessary outcome - not an aberration - of people whose own processes, but also those they live within, have become extremely dysregulated. People for whom complex feedback between dysfunctional biological, psychological, environmental, and social activity entrenches chronic dysfunction in the body. Much of this dysfunction begins in adaptive strategies, but then persists past the point of usefulness and starts doing harm. A young child learns to repress her negative emotions to protect her stressed mother, but in adulthood the chronic stress this causes dysregulates the immune system, predisposing her to illness, as Maté argues. An immune cell correctly identifies a chemical compound as threatening, but later registers a molecularly analogous bodily tissue as a threat, and attacks, as is theorised to occur in autoimmune conditions.* What was initially adaptive becomes maladaptive, and corrupts bodily processes. Process philosophers have referred to such perversities as semiotic corruption.* * This shift in perspective is not academic. If illness is in fact a process patients undergo, rather than an intruder they must exorcise, the ‘fighting disease’ approach is properly understood as a philosophy of self-harm. After all, as someone living with symptoms likely caused by brain lesions inflicted by my own immune system, what am I to fight? My own brain? Should I don the gloves and give my immune system the old one-two? How does this macho attitude help us confront and deal with the major life stressors that up to 80% of autoimmune sufferers report experiencing just before the onset of their illness?* * Or the contributing inflammatory and leaky gut issues which appear causative?* * As Mary Midgley points out*, metaphors aren’t arbitrary, they’re revealing. In this case the machine metaphor reveals how we conceive of chronic illness as a deviation from perfect mechanistic function, and how a process of ideological gatekeeping determines which explanations and remedies are legitimated, and which are not. Going beyond mechanistic materialism means leaving behind its attendant atomistic individualism too. Hence its necessary but insufficient to recognise, for example, that studies have linked emotional repression with disease risk (here’s one particularly striking one). Or that adverse experiences in an individual’s infancy predispose them to disease*. Under a more collectivist and top down viewpoint, we’re compelled to ask just what it is about our extractivist and parasitic economic system that engenders so much stress and toxicity. When we fail so consistently to meet people’s most basic human needs, why should we expect healthy development? A process worldview doesn’t have all the answers, but unless we start taking some of these questions seriously we are truly on a road to nowhere. Going beyond the mechanistic paradigm in medicine, notwithstanding all the benefits it has conferred, would bring these questions to the fore, and offer a less constrictive language with which to relate to disease. This doesn’t mean denying the utility of bottom-up analysis and mechanistic thinking, but it does mean becoming more pluralistic, appreciating top-down, process, and holistic thinking for their virtues. For stalwarts of the entrenched paradigm such a shift may prove too destabilising. Easier to speak of machines and their broken bits. Easier, but deadlier. -- -- 14 Original Philosophy Amateurish polymath. Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "

245,The challenge with early infant diagnosis of HIV,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Tosin Follow -- Listen Share I sat down and I was wondering about the known Human Immunodeficiency Virus and how children who didn't do anything but live with this virus survive. I decided to take a statistics of children living with HIV from across the planet, using power BI, I was able to visualize the dataset I got from Kaggle and I ended up with this. In 2015, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation was awarded funding by Unitaid to implement the “Optimization of early infant diagnosis (EID) networks through introduction of point-of-care (POC) EID to increase the number of infants tested and initiated on antiretroviral treatment (ART): Creating a market for affordable, effective and equitable HIV testing of exposed infants” project (2015–2019). The POC EID Data Dashboard summarizes key findings from the project countries that have introduced innovative point-of-care testing technologies. Conventional methods of diagnosis took a median of 53 days to return test results to parents. With POC, results are often returned the same day, saving more baby’s lives. To see more information about the project, go to http://www.pedaids.org/pocdashboard. Over 1.2 million newborns are exposed to HIV each year, with more than 65% in sub-Saharan Africa. If left untreated, infants infected with HIV during pregnancy or childbirth have a high risk of dying before their first birthday. For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all HIV-exposed newborns receive a virological nucleic acid test (NAT) within four to six weeks of birth with immediate return of results. Infants who are HIV-infected should start treatment without delay. Access to early infant diagnosis (EID) has steadily increased in recent years, but it varies significantly by region. By 2022, an estimated 63% of HIV-exposed infants globally received a virological test by two months of age. Coverage for EID testing rose to around 83% in eastern and southern Africa, but only to 23% in western and central Africa. Because of delays in obtaining results and further losses in the testing-to-treatment cascade, only 30% of perinatally infected infants are linked to services and started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a timely manner. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams "
246,Did Squirrels Spread Leprosy in Medieval Europe?,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Sandee Oster Follow Teatime History -- 6 Listen Share Leprosy is one of the oldest recorded human diseases; some of the earliest accepted records can be traced back to India ca. 600 BC, perhaps even 1400 BC, and China around 500 BC. Yet despite centuries having passed and massive jumps in medical treatment and understanding, the disease remains prevalent in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. While much of the disease’s evolutionary history has been revealed in ancient DNA (aDNA), the role of animal hosts and interspecies transmission remains largely unexplored. During and after the COVID-19 pandemic, zoonotic (diseases that can spread from animals to humans, pl. zoonoses) diseases took centre stage. Yet, the scientific tools used to understand these zoonotic diseases primarily only focused on modern transmission, excluding research into historic zoonoses. In a study published by Urban and colleagues in Current Biology, the researchers have presented the first ever One Health (a method that recognises the interconnectedness of humans, animals, and environmental health) approach to the understanding of the disease’s zoonotic past and how this understanding could help to manage and eradicate it in the present. This approach drew me to the study; like most people, I think of Biology and Archaeology as separate, and yet, it was only through collaboration between disciplines that this study could be produced. As a zooarchaeologist, I am no stranger to interdisciplinary study, using what I know about animal bones to interpret past climates, hunting behaviour, seasonality, etc. However, I usually think of my field as being useful for other histrically focused fields, such as for geologists who may want to know about the past climate or anthropologists who want to know more bout past hunting behaviours. To use zooarchaeology for modern medical studies is something truly groundbreaking. Zoonotic diseases have existed for as long as humans and animals have lived together, and in recent years, they have gained more prominence in modern health agendas than ever. However, little attention has been focused on historic zoonoses due to the lack of pathological and genetic research on zooarchaeological (archaeological animal) remains. However, without complete pathogen genomes from archaeological animals, understanding the long-term dynamics and nuances of animal-to-human transmission is hindered, thus making it harder to identify potential spillover and reemergence risks of current zoonotic diseases. Leprosy is mainly caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) bacteria but also, to a lesser extent, by M. lepromatosis. The disease can lead to nerve damage, chronic infection, blindness, dry skin, anosmia (smell blindness), and alopecia (hair loss). While the disease is almost unheard of in many places in the world, it persists in parts of Asia, South America, and Africa, with over 200,000 cases annually. While there is an ongoing debate about its exact origins in either Eastern Africa or India, the earliest widely accepted cases date back to India, some 1400 to 600 BC. From there, it spread eastward to China and over the ocean to Japan. Armies and traders, such as Alexander the Great’s returning armies from India (327–325BC), brought the disease to the Middle East and Greece. The Romans then spread it throughout the Mediterranean Basin and Western Europe. By the Middle Ages (1000–1400AD), the disease ran rampant throughout Europe. Humans are the primary host of the disease. Still, some animals are known to transmit it, including wild armadillos in the Americas, chimpanzees in West Africa, and red squirrels from the British Brownsea Island. These modern squirrels harbour a medieval leprosy strain, which indicates a historic transmission event. The bacteria does not survive well outside the living host’s body and thus can almost exclusively spread via human-to-human or animal-to-human contact. Considering its modern and historic interspecies transmission, leprosy was the ideal first candidate for a One Health pilot study. By studying the archaeological context of ancient cases of leprosy, the disease spread and evolution could be better understood. Throughout the medieval period, squirrels were kept as pets or used in the fur trade. Squirrel fur in England was usually acquired from Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, Russia, and the Baltic, with some squirrels also trapped in Scotland, Italy, and Ireland. These little rodents were trapped throughout the year, and their furs were used to line and trim the garments of the High and Late Medieval folk. For example, vair was a way in which the squirrel fur was laid out to decorate clothing in a checkered pattern. In many medieval images, people dressed in squirrel fur can be found. Beyond that, there are even accounts detailing the use of squirrel fur for clothing, such as the use of squirrel fur by the nuns of Montivilliers (1265 and 1266) for their pilches (type of outer garment). Such massive quantities of squirrel fur were imported, dwarfing all other animal skins. One English customer account from 1384 recorded a jaw-dropping 377,200 imported squirrel skins (all other animal skins accounted for less than 15,000). Beyond being used for their fur, squirrels were also widely used as pets. The practice is recorded in the various accounts of episcopal visitations (official visits by the bishop) and the recovery and depiction of squirrel collars and leashes. English nuns were also known to keep pet squirrels, as were the nuns of St. Sauveur d’Evreux, who kept small dogs, birds, and squirrels. And at St. Léger des Préaux, there were two small dogs and three pet squirrels. The pet squirrels were captured as kits and raised close to humans, often depicted sitting on their laps and shoulders. To reflect the opportunities for transmission of leprosy between squirrels and humans, a medieval city with both leprosy and squirrels was needed. Winchester fulfilled both needs. During medieval times, it was a key city on trading routes. From historic records, it was known to be an active participant in the preparing and selling of various lined garments, including squirrel fur. One such furrier (a workshop specialising in furs) was in Staple Gardens, which operated between the 11th and 13th centuries. During excavations, it was revealed that the site contained various foot bones belonging to cats, foxes, stoats, squirrels, and unidentified small mammals. Finding so many foot bones made sense, considering it was typical that the hands and feet of the animals often remained attached to the fur and were only later removed by the furrier when processed into garments. The city was also the site of St Mary Magdalen, a leprosarium (hospital for leprosy patients) active between the 11th and 15th centuries. Excavations of its graves revealed many individuals with leprosy-associated lesions. Using archaeological remains, aDNA, and historical sources, Urban and colleagues tried to detect M. leprae in the remains of 25 human and 12 squirrel samples. They did this by using a method called shotgun sequencing. This technique involves randomly breaking up the DNA sequence into various smaller fragments and analyzing all these random fragments to look for traces of M. lepra. The shotgun method is usually used to prevent bias from skewing the results. For the human samples, they found at least 2000 DNA fragments that matched the reference leprosy bacteria. For the squirrel samples, they also found over 2000 matches to leprosy bacteria. To ensure their results were sound, Urban and colleagues enriched the ancient DNA in the laboratory. This amplified the detectability of the small sample size and reduced the background detectability of non-relevant DNA. Three whole genome sequences were recovered from the human samples; sadly for the squirrels, only one low-coverage or not fully completed genome sequence could be reconstructed from the aDNA. These genomes were compared to reference genomes to ascertain the accuracy of the data. Their results provided multiple lines of evidence that M. leprae strains of medieval humans and squirrels belonged to the same genotype, meaning there was definitive interspecies leprosy transmission. The further genetic analysis allowed the researchers to reconstruct four new M. leprae genomes previously unknown, three from humans and one from a Eurasian red squirrel. It also successfully showed that squirrels outside of Brownsea Island carried leprosy. However, it remains unclear if the squirrels transmitted leprosy to humans first or if they became infected after contact with humans. Until this study, the historic zoonotic transmission had only been suggested via indirect evidence. However, the aDNA results provide clear, direct proof of this transmission. The results will be instrumental in understanding the diversity of leprosy strains that circulate in animal hosts and the frequency and direction of transmission to humans, other animals, and the environment. These findings could inform future medical debate and the role of animal hosts in its continued persistence in the modern day. The study conducted by Urban and colleagues showcases the value of interdisciplinary study. Using archaeological, historical and biological approaches, the researchers were able to definitively showcase that leprosy transmission between medieval humans and squirrels occurred. As a zooarchaeologist, I have been taught to look for signs of disease in animal bones. Yet, I would probably only use that information to draw conclusions about the animal. How did the disease affect the animal, and how serious was it when the creature died? Do any other bones in the assemblage have this particular disease? To find those markers of disease and implement them in a biomedical study is not something I would have considered. Yet, the One Health method has much potential for future medical studies.

247,Wanna Be Like Mike?,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Amir Alroy Follow BeingWell -- Listen Share Growing up, I was always in awe of professional athletes. I was athletic myself, so I knew how difficult it was to shoot a basketball, to serve a tennis ball or even to use a hockey stick. But I also knew all too well that bigger, stronger, faster was a real thing. My childhood hero Michael Jordan was superhuman. So I sat back and enjoyed watching the gifts he and others had been given. I also appreciated that tremendous hard work had gone into them reaching the top of their craft. And in the back of my mind, I always felt that the state-of-the-art training facilities and technologies provided to top-level athletes offered them a type of exclusive ability to reach peak performance, something beyond the reach of ordinary people like me. However, times have changed dramatically. The emergence of fitness and longevity technology has shattered the ceiling for the rest of us, democratizing access to cutting-edge training methods and empowering everyone to unleash their inner super-athlete. At the heart of this revolution is data. And the key vehicles for maximizing data collection are wearables and apps, which can serve as personal analysis performance laboratories. Smartwatches, fitness bands, rings, and other personal devices have become indispensable for athletic achievement, reliably tracking heart rate, sleep patterns, and a myriad of fitness metrics, all while serving as stylish accessories. These data are the basis of a blueprint for workouts tailored to optimize anyone’s performance. But it doesn’t stop there. While also making those devices fashionable. Fitness apps take it a step further, offering workouts inspired by the routines of professional athletes and other celebrities, complete with detailed performance analysis and nutritional guidance. With the advent of AI-driven apps, real-time data analysis now enables dynamic coaching, suggesting adjustments during workouts to ensure maximum efficiency and effectiveness. I remember, as a child, hearing about how fit MJ was, including the factoid that he only had 4% body fat. And even though I didn’t know how to measure mine (This changed after I did a personal training course in my twenties.), the whole idea of measuring body fat consistently didn’t seem possible. But now, with trackers and apps, I can know exactly where I stand, and what is required of me to improve — no matter where I am, even sitting at home. Not surprisingly, social media has the capability to serve as a platform for inspiration and learning. Icons like LeBron James and Ronaldo have changed the rules for athletic longevity, and have been nice enough to pulled back the curtain on their grueling training regimens, sharing glimpses of their workouts and recovery routines with the world. Online communities dissect these techniques, so that we can all learn from the best and apply their knowledge to their own fitness journey. Beyond those three categories, which are available to many people, technological advancements have revolutionized sports and training methodologies in more organized settings as well, such as for junior and high school sports teams. High-tech sensors, tracking systems, video analysis, and AI combine to provide an unprecedented understanding of human performance at a price that won’t break a school’s budget. High school and other amateur-level coaches can tap into these platforms to provide more informed, science-based training that pushes athletes of all levels to come closer to reaching their potential. Of course, beyond technology, there is also what I will refer to as a “healthy living revolution.” From prioritizing a clean diet to recognizing the importance of restorative sleep and recovery techniques, every athlete, professional or otherwise, is starting each day ahead of the pace set by those of previous generations. Of course, there is a much better understanding today about the importance of mental health and wellness. And this can be measured with the help of technology and wearables as well. From Headspace for relaxation to Happify for stress reduction, there are free and paid apps available to address these challenges. The future of fitness is bright, with wearables becoming more sophisticated and AI analysis more advanced. As technology continues to evolve, we all have the option and tools to move closer to our peak performance potential. The combination of dedicated effort and insights borrowed from the world’s greatest athletes empowers everyone to unlock their inner super-athlete and achieve their fitness goals. Of course, the other side of the same coin is that today, this technology gives us fewer excuses for letting ourselves go. So it will still require willpower and determination for each of us to reach our fitness potential. Will I ever reach the potential of Michael Jordan? Of course not. But fitness technology serves as a powerful tool for democratizing access to peak performance. This opens the door to informing us all on how to make the most of our athletic lives, enhancing our performance journey like never before. By embracing technology and embracing our potential, we can all train like pros and lay the foundation for a longer, healthier life filled with vitality and achievement.

258,Indian mother waits 50 years to play sport,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Piyush Jain Follow -- Listen Share A nonexistent forehand, shaky movement, and reflexes trying to slow her down. But she stands there, as the sun hits a 25° angle. Just a few moments before the temperature rises, here’s a woman who’s about to defeat a storm. And quite effortlessly so. I'm not talking about the impressive Sindhu's and Sabalenka's; they have my heart and respect. But I’m talking about the woman closer to home. The woman who sold a part of her wardrobe to ensure I could play football when the going got hard. Countless memories flood back, and I recall her specific words: ""I don't care about anything, but I want my children to be active."" I didn't really appreciate that until it all dawned upon me. All of that love must have come from a desire to be a part of it, right? From knowing the likes of Azharuddin to fighting with me during epic Federer vs. Nadal rallies, almost convincing me to support Nadal's power over Federer's elegance. From telling me tales of gully cricketers to reminiscing about a cover drive her elder brother played in the 70s, this woman carried a deep love for movement. And yet, none of that seemed to give back to her. She turned to the second-best thing: working out like a maniac. We're talking 110 KG lifts here; in our household, that's serious business. But somehow, she couldn't play. At one point, society elders looked down on women in sport. At another, patriarchy played its role. Elsewhere, she took up raising kids as her hustle, and before we knew it, play left her doorstep. It took efforts from trailblazers like Karnam Malleswari in the 2000 Olympics to even start getting comfortable with the idea of women on the podiums of major sporting events. The efforts of Sakshi, Sindhu, Deepa, Nehwal, and countless others consolidated that thought. Then Smriti and other great women sports stars finally hit it home. And hit what home, you may ask? Just the simple point: “Agar voh desh chala sakti hai, ghar bana sakti hai, toh khel toh apne baye hatoon se vo khelegi. Mauka to diya karo janab, beti hai - zaroor jeetegi.” But hey, I've drawn the narrative a bit far out. Back to the protagonist. This morning, a good 50+ years since she took her first steps on Indian soil, my mother traded her kitchen lines in our hallway for the kitchen lines on the pickleball courts. That is 50 years of a woman waiting to play a sport, any sport. That is 50 years of her watching patiently for the ball to come her way as the world passed her by. That is 50 years of absolute grit and belief in my favorite set of words: the silver lining. So this morning, when mum took up the court, she defeated 50 years of backlog and won against the storm that took decades to build up. The forehand may need practice, and the vision will set in eventually. We at Sprentzo will continue to push her, just as she and countless other moms have pushed us to take up sport. With the Sprentzo community, we don't dream of creating miracles. We just dream of being a part of a million stories like this.

260,WTF does “vulnerable” mean to a man?,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in The Hero Formula - Steven Sal Debus Follow -- Listen Share As a man, I never considered what “being vulnerable” meant beyond being “open to attack without a defence mechanism in place.” Being vulnerable meant being weak. And it does. Look at the dictionary definition, and it reinforces this… -susceptible to physical or emotional attack or harm. -in need of special care, support, or protection because of age, disability, or risk of abuse or neglect. Men can’t be any of these things in the world. As men, we are expected, pressured, and required to be strong to survive and prosper in the world. This is Requirement Number One for all men, and there is rarely another option if we are to maintain any respect. Our culture trains us to do this as our number one priority. After this number one priority, what is number two? Provide for our women and families? Priority Number Two. Yup, we are measured by our ability to use our strengths in whatever form to make money and provide for our loved ones. If we don’t, we are useless, weak, and not necessary. You might say that women are required to do the same thing, too. No, they are not. If a woman isn’t physically, intellectually or financially strong, she is not disrespected and called weak. If a woman doesn’t work, she is not seen as useless or unnecessary. To be blunt, if you are a man and you are not strong physically, intellectually or financially, you are fucked. These two priorities of our society are clear as day. And then we are supposed to be vulnerable?? Hah! Even typing this makes me feel a certain weakness like I am suggesting that men have it hard, that we are seen as one-dimensional work robots and nothing else, and that hurts our feelings and limits our ability to have any soft skills or to work on anything else except the two priorities. I can feel the possibility of resentment building up against me for such blatant truth-telling. I can feel the natural pulling away from the feminine side of the aisle, too; “Ewwhh. That’s gross.” Maybe you don’t say it, but there is a feeling — and it’s not attractive, right? So then, what is real vulnerability? How is a man supposed to be strong and vulnerable at the same time or strong sometimes and vulnerable other times, and how do we know when, where, and how? Lastly, and most importantly, how do women know what real vulnerability means? We don’t. They don’t. Nobody ever explains vulnerability coherently to either of us, and we are too busy trying to make money to spend time on finding out. So I found out for myself. I couldn’t resist not knowing anymore. Also, I am writing this article and not giving a fuck if people think I’m weak for doing so because I’m not…I’m being vulnerable. Ha! Okay, enough of my ranting. This is the most concise definition of vulnerability in a “human relationship” that I could come up with. Vulnerability. It involves a willingness to show others your deeper self (emotions, wounds and failures) while trusting that they will not use this knowledge to cause you harm. Vulnerability applies not solely to displays of painful emotions, such as sadness or anger, but to expressing true joy and enjoyment. The shadow side of vulnerability in the masculine is impassiveness or lack of emotions in all scenarios. Vulnerability in terms of victimhood, helplessness and hysteria is the shadow side of the divine feminine. Embracing vulnerability means acknowledging that we are human. It is an integral part of building connections and relationships with others and is the only path to finding lasting love and companionship. Hopefully this helps.

261,Black Manhood in the Face of Physical Challenges,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in National Center for Institutional Diversity Follow Spark: Elevating Scholarship on Social Issues -- 4 Listen Share By Nazsa S. Baker, Christopher St. Vil, Hashim Garrett On May 7, 1990, 15-year-old Hashim Garrett recalled a sound of alarm while walking to the corner store with his friends. After he heard his friend yell “Look out! Run!” he turned and saw someone else around his age aiming a Tech 9 at him and his group of friends and he began to run. He noticed while running away from the unloading firearm that his pants made a funny movement and he felt something hard hit him in his back. Although he didn’t realize it at the time, the movement his pants made were bullets going through his leg and the pain in his back was another bullet. Aside from the two bullets Hashim felt, there were four additional bullets. Six bullets passed through him, leaving him with a total of 12 entry and exit gunshot wounds. Hashim fell to the ground and when he tried to move, he couldn’t. Most importantly, he couldn’t feel his legs; he felt alone. Post injury, Hashim had to learn to cope with his disability and continue with life. From ages 16 to 18, he eventually got into a relationship and purchased a car. By 19, he had a full-time job, graduated from high school, and went to college. However, it was during his freshman year that he struggled with undiagnosed depression. He found himself self-medicating with alcohol, drugs, and even different relationships, trying to heal. Navigating life as a teen with a firearm acquired spinal cord injury and a chronic medical condition, he learned to focus on what he could control. His disability didn’t prevent him from doing the things able-bodied young men were doing such as getting a job, being in a relationship, driving, or furthering his education. His concept of being a man was being self-reliant, providing, and feeling like a protector. His concept of manhood and masculinity changed as he met and engaged with older men who were mentors, fathers, and husbands. What he learned from them is that masculinity also meant being emotionally available, sensitive, understanding, compassionate, forgiving, in addition to being a provider and protector. These attributes weren’t mutually exclusive, and they reshaped his understanding of what it meant and currently means to be a man. He came to realize that the intersecting experiences of being a black man can be just as emasculating as having a physical disability which often leads to feeling stigmatized, marginalized, powerless, and weak. Intersectionality through the intersection between gender and race place Black men at such a disadvantage within the social hierarchy that by some, they are viewed as a crippled demographic. However, he refused to allow his disability to make him feel inferior and chose to draw strength from knowing he’s a survivor, not a victim. He recognized the resilience and fortitude required to thrive in a society that often works against someone like him, a Black man with a firearm acquired disability. Hashim’s story invites us to explore two questions: Black men and boys in the U.S. disproportionately experience acts of violence and are at increased risk of victimization compared to their racial counterparts. While research suggests that men and boys in general are more likely than women and girls to experience potentially traumatic events such as robberies and simple assaults, for black boys living in poor neighborhoods in particular, this risk is exacerbated due to alternative socialization influences that increase the likelihood that they will be the targets of crime or violent victimization. Furthermore, issues associated with violent injury do not end in the hospital because patients of violent injury are still in need of services post-discharge. In fact, some research suggests that the experiences of black males within the trauma unit/medical setting is less than favorable compared to their racial counterparts. This disparity in rates of violent victimization often result in them acquiring disabilities that have lasting impacts on their quality of life. Intersecting and Negotiating Identities Able-bodied individuals often overlook individuals with physical disabilities, intentionally or unintentionally rendering disability invisible. It is often said that disability regardless of the mechanism by which it is acquired (i.e., at birth or due to accidents) makes men less masculine. Once a physical disability is acquired, men’s bodies are seen as less than ideal and most importantly devalued. This is due to the significant emphasis American society puts on men called hegemonic masculinity, “the currently accepted answer to the problem of the legitimacy of patriarchy which guarantees the dominant position of men and the subordination of women”. Hegemonic masculinity is grounded in bodily performance that emphasizes power, dominance, and physical strength over others. Research has suggested that attention to three social processes are necessary to understand the experiences of disability: stigma associated with disability, gendered interactions, and the importance of the body in enacting gender roles. The presence of a disability or handicap compels those around the disabled person to view them as incapable and impotent; that a disabled body is missing something or lacking something essential. Some men with physical disabilities feel the societal pressure consistent with the requirements of hegemonic masculinities. There is an immediate need to perform and consistently re-perform masculine tasks such as being the breadwinner. Having economic power not only speaks to financial independence but the ability to provide and take care of those who are considered dependents (i.e., women and children). A key feature of what it means to be a “real man” is independence. Men with physical disabilities are constantly fighting against skewed perceptions of what men with physical disabilities can and cannot do. Disabled men specifically, in comparison to able bodied men, may be feminized or seen as incapable of autonomy, bodily strength, and aggressiveness. Lastly, because the physically disabled body deviates from the expected norm, it complicates how one engages in gendered performances. This complexity has resulted in a dichotomy of sorts where some physically disabled male bodies are viewed as vectors of weakness whereas others are interpreted as pillars of strength and admiration for overcoming adversity. Marginalized populations, specifically Black men, are constantly constructing and reconstructing masculinities because they are denied access to the true embodiment of hegemonic masculinities. Despite hegemonic masculinity being exclusionary and most men never achieving it, men in general benefit from the mere idea of it. Black men are forced to idealize hegemonic masculinities and perpetuate stereotypical ideas of manhood while experiencing significant amounts of inequality in their everyday lives from their levels of education, and economic opportunities (institutional racism and oppression). Black men have unique responses to their social worlds because of their intersecting identities. Black men experience masculinities in an interesting way that require them to move between being powerless in mainstream society and holding power within their own communities. While their general intersectionality (race, class, gender, and level of education) already marginalizes them, adding a disability to the equation further marginalizes this demographic leading them to deviate even further from the mean of normality. Because of the way masculinity is defined, men with disabilities in general, must negotiate the limitations of their bodies with respect to the prevailing demands of what American society says a man is and does. However, when you’re a Black man with an invisible or visible disability, you’re at a disadvantage. Hashim’s story teaches us it is important for men to alter the way they think about masculinities, and this would be helpful when one is coping or trying to make it to the next level. We can address systemic injustices and build a stronger, more unified community by mobilizing, mentoring, supporting, and advocating for other men instead of basing decisions on hegemonic masculinity not meant for Black men.

265,WTF does “vulnerable” mean to a man?,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in The Hero Formula - Steven Sal Debus Follow -- Listen Share As a man, I never considered what “being vulnerable” meant beyond being “open to attack without a defence mechanism in place.” Being vulnerable meant being weak. And it does. Look at the dictionary definition, and it reinforces this… -susceptible to physical or emotional attack or harm. -in need of special care, support, or protection because of age, disability, or risk of abuse or neglect. Men can’t be any of these things in the world. As men, we are expected, pressured, and required to be strong to survive and prosper in the world. This is Requirement Number One for all men, and there is rarely another option if we are to maintain any respect. Our culture trains us to do this as our number one priority. After this number one priority, what is number two? Provide for our women and families? Priority Number Two. Yup, we are measured by our ability to use our strengths in whatever form to make money and provide for our loved ones. If we don’t, we are useless, weak, and not necessary. You might say that women are required to do the same thing, too. No, they are not. If a woman isn’t physically, intellectually or financially strong, she is not disrespected and called weak. If a woman doesn’t work, she is not seen as useless or unnecessary. To be blunt, if you are a man and you are not strong physically, intellectually or financially, you are fucked. These two priorities of our society are clear as day. And then we are supposed to be vulnerable?? Hah!
