0," Two deaths as a result of a listeriosis outbreak linked to a plant-based milk recall are in Ontario, provincial health officials confirmed Thursday. Silk brand almond milk, coconut milk, almond-coconut milk and oat milk, as well as Great Value brand almond milk, were recalled earlier this month. ""At this point in time, the Ministry of Health can confirm that 2 deaths in Ontario have been related to this outbreak,"" a spokesperson told CP24 in an email. ""The Ministry of Health is working closely with Local Public Health Agencies, Public Health Ontario, the CFIA, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada regarding the recall of these products."" At least 12 lab-confirmed cases of listeriosis have been reported in connection with the recall, including 10 in Ontario and one each in Quebec and Nova Scotia. All of the affected products, of which there are 18, include the product code 7825 and best-before dates up to and including Oct. 4. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), products contaminated with listeria may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick and include symptoms like vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness. “Pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, the infection can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth. In severe cases of illness, people may die,” PHAC said in the recall. READ MORE: What is listeriosis, the illness recently linked to a recall of plant-based milks? Of the reported listeriosis cases in Canada, 67 per cent were reported in women and the ages of those hospitalized are between 37 and 89. PHAC said the people who became sick developed symptoms between August 2023 and early July 2024. Health officials warned that more infections may continue to be reported as the illness reporting period for this outbreak is between nine and 35 days. In a statement issued Wednesday, the president of Danone Canada, Frédéric Guichard, said all 15 of the Silk products have been removed from shelves across the country. ""The news in this notice is devastating and our most sincere sympathies go out to the families and loved ones during this difficult time,” he said. It’s unclear if the three Great Value products, which are produced by Walmart, are still on the shelves. If you believe you have one of the affected products in your home, PHAC advises to throw the items out or return them to where they were purchased.

1," A massive rainstorm which flooded roads, basements and businesses in the city Tuesday is raising questions about Toronto's preparedness when it comes to major weather events. The storm, which dumped a month's worth of rain on the city in a matter of hours, overwhelmed sewer systems and waterways, causing damage and hampering transit. While such storms are rare, they are not unheard of. Another storm about a decade ago in 2013 caused major flooding, submerging vehicles and necessitating the rescue of passengers from a half-submerged GO Train. With more adverse weather expected due to climate change, the city has undertaken flood mitigation work over the past decade, including a massive project to reroute the mouth of the Don River to add flood protection in the Port Lands – a project which marked a major milestone just last week and which is expected to be compete by the end of this year. But the fact that the city has undertaken flood protection work over the past few years left some wondering why the city was then so overwhelmed by Tuesday's storm. Speaking on CTV Your Morning Wednesday, Mayor Olivia Chow said flood mitigation is at various stages of work in areas across the city, with some projects still waiting for dollars to flow. ""The west area, still some of those homeowners can't even get insurance for their basements because they've been flooding so much,"" Chow said. ""So we're waiting for the federal government to join us to really do flood mitigation measures in the west end of the city. It's about $300 million, and they've said yes, it's just we're waiting for the funds to flow."" Chow said the city also has ""very, very aggressive"" plans to build more housing in the East Harbour area, east of the Don River, but is also waiting on about $200 million from the federal government for flood protection. However she did note that Ottawa has contributed in a ""big"" way to flood protection with the project to naturalize the mouth of the Don River. One of the massive concrete ""plugs"" separating the newly-created stretch of river was removed last week. Once all of the plugs have been removed, the river will flow out through the new mouth, instead of emptying into the narrow Keating Channel. ""The last plug about to be pulled out in the next couple of months, that will allow the Don River to flow into Lake Ontario, and that would ease a lot of the flooding,"" Chow said. ""So it's happening, but we're almost there."" In a post, Waterfront Toronto confirmed that while a small amount of water from the Don River entered the new stretch of river, the project was not at a stage of completion that would have allowed water to flow through to the new mouth Tuesday. ""A small notch was also recently made at the west end of the North Plug to allow for construction of the riverbank where it meets the wall. Some water and debris flowed into the new river here, and the water level was a little higher than usual,"" Waterfront Toronto said in its post. ""Otherwise, the storm did not impact the construction site and increased waters from the Don River were still moving by way of the Keating Channel."" However the organization also noted that the project is not meant to protect all areas that were affected by Tuesday's flooding. ""The Port Lands Flood Protection project is designed to protect the Port Lands and portions of Leslieville and South Riverdale in a storm even bigger than yesterday's. It is not designed to mitigate flooding on the Don Valley Parkway, which remains within the Don River flood plain."" Speaking with CP24 Tuesday, Environment Canada Senior Climatologist Dave Phillips said that while the city might typically see one or two thunderstorms with heavy rain in a month, Tuesday brought three in quick succession and the infrastructure was not designed to cope. ""So huge amounts of rain and the system, the city infrastructure, couldn't take it. It was overworked. He pointed out that Toronto is ""a different city"" than it was about 20 or 30 years ago, with far more concrete surfaces and less green space that could absorb heavy rainfall. Chow reiterated Wednesday that the city has been looking at ways to encourage people not to pave their properties over with nonporous surfaces. ""We want to do more. For big parking lots, if it's just concrete, the water basically just runs off,"" Chow said. ""What we want them to do is have interlocking bricks, so that the water can seep into the ground, rather than just run off and flood everything else."" Earlier this year, staff proposed a separate tax be added to utility bills as a fixed charge, depending on the size of the paved area on a property.  The move led to cries that Toronto was trying to add a ""rain tax."" Chow directed staff to take another look following an outcry, but said at the time that it was important to have a plan that supports more green infrastructure, prevents flooding, and keeps water bills low.

2," It appears that not even race car drivers are immune to Toronto gridlock. The Ontario Honda Dealers Indy held a press conference at the Exhibition Grounds on Thursday where some of the drivers who will compete in this weekend’s races spoke with reporters. But one of them almost didn’t make it. Lochie Hughes, an Australian driver who competes in the USF Pro 2000 series, told reporters that he nearly missed the event due to the traffic and had to eventually find another way to get to the track. “I am just super happy to be here in Toronto. I got stuck in traffic as well so I actually rented a bike to get here on time and then ran the rest of the way,” he said. “It is cool to just be outside along the water there. It reminds me a little bit of back home in Australia, people outdoors playing tennis.” The westbound lanes of Lake Shore Boulevard West are closed from Strachan Avenue to British Columbia Drive in order to accommodate the annual street race and police have previously warned drivers to expect “significant delays” in the area. Hughes might not have gotten that message but he was nonetheless in good spirits on Thursday as he spoke about his impressions of the city. “There are Smarties here. At our hotel we have Smarties so I feel right at home,” he said. Hughes isn’t the only visitor to Toronto who has had to alter their plans due to the city’s notorious gridloick. Last month former One Direction member Niall Horan made headlines after he posted a video which showed him walking to the Scotiabank Arena for a performance because the city’s traffic was “too bad.” In the video, which was sped up and had The Proclaimer’s “I’m Gonna Be (500 miles)” playing in the background, Horan was seen walking from just west of Yonge Street to an underground entrance of Scotiabank Arena past Bay Street. “In all the years I’ve been playing shows, I don’t think I’ve ever walked into a venue,” Horan said in the video. Hughes is scheduled to compete in two USF Pro 2000 series races this weekend. The main event, the NTT INDYCAR SERIES race, will wrap up a weekend of racing at 1:30 p.m. on Sunday.

3," Shoppers could soon see an expanded selection of alcoholic beverages at their local grocery store, as a strike by LCBO workers continues to drag on. The 450 grocery stores that are licensed to sell alcohol in Ontario are permitted to order ready-to-drink beverages and larger packs of beer as of today, meaning that the beverages could start showing up on some store shelves relatively soon. The province had previously set a date of August 1 to allow grocery stores to sell ready-to-drink cocktails but announced earlier this week that it was moving up the timeline. Ready-to-drink beverages have been at the forefront of the LCBO strike, with the Ontario Public Service Employees Union previously identifying it as a key issue for his members. Premier Doug Ford, for his part, has said that he is unwilling to budge when it comes to its government’s plans to allow grocers to sell ready-to-drink cocktails. “If they want to negotiate over RTD (Ready-To-Drink beverages), the deal is off,” Ford told reporters at a news conference in Etobicoke last week. “Let me be very clear. It is done, it is gone. That ship has sailed. It’s halfway across Lake Ontario.” LCBO outlets across Ontario have been shuttered since talks broke down and about 9.000 OPSEU members walked off the job on July 5. Talks between the union and the province resumed on Wednesday and are continuing today, OPSEU has told CTV News Toronto. Meanwhile, the province continues to move ahead with its plans to expand the sale of some alcoholic beverages. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance told CP24.com earlier this week that the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario has issued licenses to 3,153 convenience stores to sell beer, wine, cider and ready-to-drink beverages since applications first opened on June 17. An additional 54 grocery stores have also been issued licenses. “In less than two months, on September 5, the Ontario marketplace will hit a new milestone with all eligible convenience stores able to sell beer, cider, wine, and ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages. As the first segment of the market to be expanded, we are pleased that so many convenience stores are gearing up to provide people with more choice,” Colin Blachar said. “As the province implements its plan, the government will continue to constantly evaluate how it can deliver choice and convenience.” The Ontario government has previously indicated that the LCBO will retain the exclusive right to sell spirits in Ontario, even as it allows more retailers to sell other alcoholic beverages.

4," Police are warning the public after a large quantity of unapproved prescription drugs were seized during a recent raid in York Region. York Regional Police (YRP) launched an investigation into the trafficking of controlled substances in Vaughan in May. On July 11, police executed a search warrant at a home near Highway 7 and Woodstream Boulevard, east of Martin Grove Road. Police say that officers recovered an “abundance” of prescription drugs that have not been approved by regulatory authorities for “safety, efficacy and quality or for sale in Canada.” The drugs include anabolic steroids, hormone receptors, testosterone replacements, synthetic steroids, erectile dysfunction medications, and opiates. Police said they also seized a quantity of pills they believe to be MDMA as well as two fraudulently registered motor vehicles. Two Vaughan residents have been charged. Jamal Hassan, 29 and Ashley Cunningham, 34, are both facing drug-related charges. “York Regional Police is reminding the public that prescription drugs being sold on the illegal market are often imported from overseas and do not have the same stringent safety regulations as Health Canada,” police said in a news release. “No prescription drugs should be purchased from unlicensed sources, as they may not contain the product that is being advertised. This includes unknown ingredients, incorrect dosages and contamination. Consuming these products can lead to serious health consequences, including hospitalization or even death. Always use legitimate channels to obtain prescription medications safely.” Police continue to investigate and are asking anyone with information to contact investigators.

5," Toronto is still drying out after a storm dropped more than a month’s worth of rain on the city earlier this week, leaving some residents to deal with flooded basements and property damage left in its wake. “I was literally shocked,” Karma Kunsang, a resident of the Rockcliffe–Smythe neighbourhood in Toronto’s northwest, told CTV News Toronto. The area was particularly hit hard by Tuesday’s rainfall and the water levels in Kunsang’s basement reached knee-high height, destroying furniture and toppling over large appliances as the storm surged. “This place, it was like a movie. When this happens to your own house, your brain stops working,” he said. Toronto flooding: Pictures, videos show heavy rainfall in downtown core Eric Swanson lives nearby and saw at least a foot of water in his home’s lower level, despite installing a pressure-sealing door and powered backwater valve in the basement. “Do we call insurance? Do we not call insurance? The mould and the disgustingness of the water and all those issues…I need to get this properly cleaned and taken care of so that my house is still livable,” Swanson said. Homes weren’t the only things damaged in the record-breaking storm, which saw nearly 100 millimetres of rainfall in just a few hours. Several vehicles were also abandoned by their drivers after water gushed onto major roadways across the city, including the Don Valley Parkway where 14 people needed to be rescued. The torrential downpour is already being compared to Toronto’s 2013 storm – listed as one of the most expensive natural disasters in Canada, according to insurance payouts. Data from the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) shows that claims filed in the aftermath of that weather event reached $1 billion. While it’s too early to put a dollar figure on the damage left it the aftermath of Tuesday’s storm, the IBC told CTV News Toronto that the two events are “similar.” “We can’t determine, at this point, what the magnitude of this event is,” Anne Marie Thomas, IBC’s director of consumer and industry relations, said. “We can’t say what this event will cost because, as you can imagine, not everyone has filed an insurance claim yet.” Insurance tips for flooded house, car If your basement was flooded or you needed to abandon your vehicle, the first thing you should do is reach out to you insurer or insurance broker to check your coverage. “Not all [insurance] policies have coverage for weather events like this one,” Thomas said, adding that sewer backup coverage and overland flood coverage would be needed in the case of home insurance, both of which are optional and not always included in basic policies. “A typical homeowner's insurance policy doesn't cover damage caused by sewer backup or flood. It only covers [damage] caused by a burst pipe or something like that in your home,” she said. After you’ve determined what type of coverage you have, the next step is making an inventory of all the damaged items, including taking pictures and videos of those items. If you have proof of purchase, such as a receipt, for an item you’re looking to make a claim for, that will assist in the process. One important note is to hold on to any damaged items before you dispose of them, because, as Thomas explains, the insurance adjuster will want to see the damage as it was at the time of the event. “So if your house is damaged, and you go, ‘OK, I'm just gonna get rid of this.’ Wait until your insurance company says it's okay. Unless that item is posing a health hazard or is a danger,” she said. READ MORE: What to know about insurance claims after Tuesday's flash flooding in Ontario As well, if you rented any equipment to dry out your home, such as a shop vac or industrial fan, keep those receipts as you could be reimbursed. In terms of vehicle insurance for owners who were forced to ditch their vehicle amid the flooding, much like home insurance, only certain policies will cover the damage. “In order for those vehicles to be covered by insurance, the owner of the vehicle would have to have purchased collision or comprehensive coverage or ‘all perils’ coverage,” Thomas said. “Those are the optional physical damage coverages that you can buy for your car. If you have that, then your insurance company would pay to either fix the vehicle or write off your vehicle.” Typically, following a storm like the one on Tuesday, Thomas said the full “realization” of the damage isn’t known until 30 to 45 days after the event.

7," A massive summer storm which brought flooding to Toronto earlier this week also dealt a blow to one of the city's major food banks. The North York Harvest Food Bank says it suffered around $50,000 in lost food and damage from the flooding, hampering its ability to provide to those in need. Natasha Bowes, director of development and marketing for the food bank, told CP24 Thursday that the rain overwhelmed their systems. ""It ended up backing up onto our loading docks. We were trying to rescue the food. The power went out,"" she said. The organization tried to transport some of the food to a cold storage facility, but much of it was lost. ""Then while we were trying to save the food that we had in the fridges, we ended up damaging one of our trucks. There was some water damage. So just things built, one over another.

8," New condominium sales plummeted to a 27-year-low during the first six months of 2024 as a “sharp downturn in construction starts” in Toronto continued to impact inventory levels, a new report by a real estate research group suggests. Urbanation Inc. says that just 3,159 new condo units were sold in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area during the first half of the year, representing a 57 per cent decline from the same time period one year prior and a 72 per cent drop as compared to the 10-year average. Urbanation says that it was also the slowest first half for new condo sales since 1997. “With condo prices still near record highs and only a modest 25 basis point decline in interest rates in June from their 22-year high, buyers remained cautious in anticipation of further rate cuts and amidst a burgeoning supply of units for sale,” Urbanation President Shaun Hildebrand said in a news release. “The continued weakening in condo market conditions during the second quarter of 2024 is likely to cause more projects that were slated to launch this year to remain on hold, while others that are struggling to meet sales thresholds for construction financing may ultimately be pulled from the market.” Urbanation says that the total number of unsold condo units in the GTHA has now reached a record high of 25,89, which equates to about 34 months of supply. That is approximately 10,000 more units than the long-term average, the group points out. However, despite the surplus prices have remained relatively stable. Urbanation says that the average asking price for unsold units declined just 2.6 per cent over the past year and by only 4.5 per cent over the past two years. “This demonstrates how sticky new condominium prices have become due to high development and financing costs, and record prices paid for land at the market peak,” the release notes. The GTA’s real estate market has faced significant headwinds over the last two years due to a significant increase in the price of borrowing. In June the average selling price of a home in the Greater Toronto Area across all property types was $1,162,167. That is down from a peak of $1,334,062 in February 2022, which was the prior to the Bank of Canada beginning its interest rate hiking cycle.

9," A Toronto rapper's firearm charges have been dropped after a judge found police breached his Charter rights and gave “tailored” testimonies while on the stand. In an Ontario Superior Court decision released last month, Justice Sandra Nishikawa handed Omary Bent, 27, a stay of proceedings. He was acquitted of four firearm charges laid on him in the summer of 2021. The acquittal was granted, in part, after Nishikawa found that the officers used excessive force in dragging Bent out of his Etobicoke condominium by his hair and breached his right to counsel in questioning him without a lawyer present. In turn, the judge found the court should “distance itself” from the evidence obtained during the raid. Download our app to get alerts on your device Get the latest local updates right to your inbox According to court documents, the Toronto Police Service (TPS) began looking into Bent after it was suggested by a confidential source that he’d been dealing drugs and possessed a firearm. Police raided Brent’s home on July 27, 2021, deploying a Taser on him within minutes. According to Bent, he was hit with the energy weapon while his hands were in the air. One of the officers involved, however, said the Taser had been deployed as Bent reached for a satchel that was later found with a loaded pistol inside. Another officer told the court that the Taser had been deployed as Bent walked towards the police with his hand in his pocket. After being Tased, Bent was then dragged shirtless from his home by his hair, the judge found. Bent testified that the officer dragging him said, “I should have f*****g killed you,” before leaving him with another officer in the building’s stairwell. A photograph taken of Bent by his sister, later used as evidence, shows a bald, raw spot where one of his braids had detached from the skin of his scalp. Bent testified that police then asked for access to his vehicle before giving him the chance to speak with a lawyer, at one point threatening to break the windows if he didn’t comply. Police, meanwhile, have insisted that Brent told officers where they could find the keys without coercion. Nothing was found during a police search of the vehicle. Bent did, however, did admit that he threw a guitar case from his 37th floor balcony. Court documents say that a gun was later found inside that case. Police ultimately charged Bent with one count each of possession of a loaded prohibited firearm and possession of a non-restricted firearm without a licence, along with two counts of possession of a prohibited device, namely an over-capacity magazine. 'False and misleading' In examining the testimonies given by the officers on what led them to Taser Bent, the judge found one of the officer’s accounts “impossible to accept.” She ruled that his testimony that Brent had reached for a satchel contradicted not only the accounts of other officers present but his own. In a report made prior to giving his testimony, the officer had stated Bent had dropped his hands and made no mention of a satchel. In that report, the officer had checked ‘yes’ under ‘Subject Confirmed Armed.’ Bent was not found to be armed. “In this case, checking “yes” [...] was false and misleading,” the judge wrote in her decision. “In my view, [the officer] completed the CEW Report in a manner that would avoid questioning of his use of a Taser.” The judge also took issue with the testimony of three other officers who said they did not recall if Bent had been shirtless at the time of the raid or not. The judge found their accounts inaccurate and described them as an effort to suggest Bent may have had a hidden weapon. “In my view, the officers’ subsequent attempt to justify the use of force by different after-the-fact explanations belies any good faith belief in the necessity of using force at the time,” she wrote. Ultimately, Nishikawa ruled that the deployment of the Taser constituted an excessive use of force and in turn, violated Bent’s Charter rights. The request made by officers for Bent to hand over his keys before speaking to a lawyer was also deemed a breach of rights. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for the Toronto Police Service said that an adverse comment made by a judge cannot be taken as a definitive ruling on officer conduct. “It is important to understand that negative judicial comments do not necessarily constitute misconduct,” Stephanie Sayer wrote in an email to CTV News Toronto. “When officers are testifying in court, they are not the ones on trial. Like any witness, the officers are not parties to the proceeding – they have no right to representation, no ability to call witnesses or make submissions, no right to make legal arguments, etc. They are there to answer the questions posed to them.” In this case, Sayer said the Crown had reviewed the officers’ testimony and found no evidence of misconduct. Still, she said the service’s Professional Standards Unit was investigating the allegations. Case does damage to trust in policing: Lawyer Bent’s lawyers, Hilary Dudding and Maxime Bédard, told CTV News Toronto that the case serves as an important lesson in public trust in policing. “It's so important that the public feel confident in the police and feel that the police are going to be enforcing laws fairly and within the boundary of the law themselves,” Dudding said. “Even one case like this does damage to the trust that the community has in the police service.” “Police are like every other group of people,” she continued. “There's always going to be frailty there, but looking at a system that takes this more seriously and provides some accountability to the public when this happens is really, really important.” Dudding added that it shouldn’t be left up to individuals to face off against the authorities in court, and put forth the idea of a public oversight body tasked with reviewing these kinds of claims more strenuously. “When an internal process takes place, one wonders how many of these complaints are reviewed or how seriously they're taken, and what the consequences are,” she continued. “We’d all benefit from a more strenuous approach to these things, because we need to focus on the issues that really matter in court, as opposed to trying to figure out what really happened during an engagement with the police.” In unrelated proceedings, Bent is facing a charge of second-degree murder in connection with the stabbing of 24-year-old Shacquan Harrison .

10," Police have arrested three individuals and seized a dozen stolen vehicles following a raid at an alleged “chop shop” in Milton. Halton police say that investigators with its organized crime unit began an investigation on July 11 after identifying a recently stolen vehicle from Peel Region at a rural address in Milton. Police say that officers subsequently executed a search warrant at the property and arrested three individuals at the scene. Police say that 12 stolen vehicles “in various stages of being disassembled” were also recovered. Haider Ameer Khan, 25, of Brampton, Shehroz Nadeem, 26, of Mississauga and Jaskaran Sing, 24, of Grimsby, are each charged with 12 counts of possession of property obtained by crime over $5,000 and one count of trafficking in possession of property obtained by crime over $5,000. Police say that Khan had also been subject to a prior release order at the time of his arrest for similar offences. All three suspects have since been released on bail and are due back in court on Aug. 26. Police continue to investigate and are asking anyone with information to contact investigators.

12," As floodwaters poured into a Mississauga long-term care home –submerging much of the ground floor – rescue crews worked to rapidly get residents into inflatable rafts to evacuate the property while others worked on stopping the water from rising further. The operation that unfolded over the course of 12 hours on Tuesday following torrential rains eventually saw more than 100 residents safely moved out of the nursing home, some by raft and others on foot once the water receded. Mississauga Fire Captain Dan Herd said the evacuation of the Tyndall Seniors Village, which saw multiple emergency services from across the Greater Toronto Area come together, was on a scale he hadn't seen before. ""There was water inside the building, the first floor – in between probably three to four feet high on the walls – and some windows were broken, damaged,” Herd said, adding that the parking lot was inundated by water at one point. ""We set up an instant action plan, and we started to move thousands of litres of water at a time ... the water rescue team was using their rescue boats to assist the removal of ambulatory patients and occupants."" The flooding began after incredibly heavy rains on Tuesday caused the nearby Etobicoke Creek to overflow, Herd said. Once enough floodwater had been pumped out of the home, some residents were able to walk out of the building, he said. Those who were unable to walk were carried down stairs and out of the building by first responders using lifting equipment, Herd said. ""This is my first personal experience of something to this size,” he said of the operation. None of the residents were injured, said Tom Kukolic, acting deputy chief for Peel Region's paramedics service. Once first responders determined that none of the 116 residents needed emergency care, efforts then shifted to a ""safe extrication and relocation"" operation, Kukolic said, with residents eventually taken to two long-term care homes and two hotels. ""Once the paramedics and firefighters were able to bring the residents out of the home and move them to the triage area, we then had assistance from Peel Wheel-Trans, Toronto TTC Wheel-Trans, and Mississauga Transit,” Kukolic said. The relocation effort was “a seamless transition” thanks to the collaboration of several emergency response teams, including York Region and Toronto paramedics, he said. “Extricating people, it’s very difficult. It is very laborious work ... however, what we do from a paramedic practice perspective, is ensure that we have enough people to safely move residents,"" Kukolic said. Tuesday's massive downpour caused chaos across Toronto and its surrounding communities, with flooding shutting down several major routes and terminals and knocking out power to thousands. Mississauga Fire Chief Deryn Rizzi called the response at the nursing home “a great example” of how multiple agencies across the Greater Toronto Area can work together. ""We are there to work collaboratively together, to address the incident to achieve a common goal, which in this case, it was to evacuate the residents safely,"" he said. For Kukolic, the full-day operation showed how preparation can help first responders deal with large-scale responses triggered by sudden events such as Tuesday's flooding. ""I was proud to be a member of paramedic services and a first responder,” he said. ""It was really great to see how everybody came together to ensure that our most vulnerable were taken care of.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 18, 2024.

13," Ford Motor Co. says it plans to assemble its F-Series Super Duty pickup trucks at its Oakville , Ont., assembly plant beginning in 2026, a move that comes amid delays to the start of planned electric vehicle production at the site. The U.S. automaker said the move would add capacity of up to 100,000 additional units and support 1,800 jobs at the plant to be filled by workers represented by Unifor. Ford announced plans last year to spend $1.8 billion to transform the facility into a hub for electric vehicle manufacturing, including vehicle and battery pack assembly. But after planning to start EV production at the plant in 2025, the company said in April it was pushing that back to 2027 to give the consumer market more time to develop and allow for further development of EV battery technology. Ford said some employees would remain on site during the plant transformation but there would be layoffs, noting it would work with Unifor to mitigate the effect of the delay on its workforce. Bringing production of Super Duty pickups to the Canadian plant means some employees will return to work a year earlier than expected, the company said Thursday. “Super Duty is a vital tool for businesses and people around the world and, even with our Kentucky Truck Plant and Ohio Assembly Plant running flat out, we can’t meet the demand,"" said Ford president and CEO Jim Farley in a press release. ""At the same time, we look forward to introducing three-row electric utility vehicles, leveraging our experience in three-row utility vehicles and our learnings as America’s No. 2 electric vehicle brand to deliver fantastic, profitable vehicles."" The 1,800 positions are 400 more than would initially have been needed to produce the three-row electric vehicle following the plant's overhaul, the company said. ""This is the best plan for Ford, and for the Oakville area and Ontario, in general,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice-president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, in an interview. If the automaker had not reinvested in the plant, he added: ""The potential for closure is there and getting Ford to come back to Oakville would be very difficult as many of the plants that have closed have simply disappeared from the map."" While Canada's push toward electric vehicles is a great long-term plan, consumer demand is not there yet, said Fiorani. Ford is spending around US$3 billion to expand Super Duty production to Canada, which includes US$2.3 billion to install assembly and integrated stamping operations at the Oakville facility. It said the increased production also adds around 150 jobs to the company's Windsor Engine Complex, which will manufacture more V8 engines for the Super Duty trucks. The move was welcomed by the union, which called the EV production delays ""too long, too disruptive and too harmful."" “This new retooling plan for the Oakville plant addresses our union’s concerns,"" said Unifor national president Lana Payne in a press release. “Working with our local unions and company executives, we came to an agreement that will not only see our members back to work sooner, it protects our members’ jobs well into the future."" Unifor said it anticipates an electrified version of the pickup will also be produced at the Oakville plant ""later in the decade."" Fiorani said demand for EVs is growing but the main problem is excess supply, combined with saturated competition among automakers and lower profits on electric cars. ""There's a lot of vehicles being built and offered on the market for a relatively small number of buyers,"" he said. ""We're going to see more and more people transition toward electric vehicles and as that happens, we're going to see more vehicles being added to the line-up."" Automakers have to build vehicles that are in demand by consumers and the federal government's move to mandate EV sales may not work without sufficient charging infrastructure, said Brian Kingston, president and CEO of Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association. ""It really all depends on building the support for the customer and ultimately, increasing our clean electricity generation, our transmission and charging infrastructure capacity,"" he said. He added that a more aggressive approach to building charging infrastructure is needed for faster uptake of EVs. Ontario Economic Development Minister Vic Fedeli praised the announcement, saying in a statement it ""demonstrates the company's continued confidence in the end-to-end automotive supply chain we have built in the province, and in our world-class manufacturing talent."" Ford's spending plans for the Oakville plant were first announced in 2020 as part of union negotiations, with workers seeking long-term production commitments and the Detroit Three automakers eventually agreeing to invest in Canadian operations in concert with spending agreements with the Ontario and federal governments. The two governments agreed to provide $295 million each in funding to secure the Ford investment. Federal guidelines are targeting 20 per cent of new vehicles sold in Canada to be zero-emission by 2026, at least 60 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035.

14," The city dumped more than 1,300 megalitres of partially treated wastewater into Lake Ontario during Tuesday’s torrential downpour , which is enough to fill 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools. A city spokesperson said three wastewater plants were “ bypassing ,” a process in which stormwater and sewage are diverted from a secondary treatment procedure. IN PHOTOS: A look back at the massive flooding across Toronto “The bypassed wastewater still goes through screening, grit removal, primary treatment, phosphorous removal and full disinfection to ensure the treated water always meets strict federal and provincial regulations,” the spokesperson said, adding that the process is done to protect the plants’ ability to continue treating wastewater during an extreme rainstorm. Health officials have advised against swimming in Lake Ontario for 48 hours after rainfall due to the possible presence of high levels of bacteria. On Wednesday, all of Toronto’s beaches were under a red flag. The 10 beaches were marked unsafe for swimming due to high levels of E.coli in the water. “Much of the sewage that may have been deposited after the storm should be disinfected through exposure to UV through the sunlight. It can be unsafe to swim, even at designated swimming beaches, for up to 48 hours after a major rainfall,” the city said. “Storms increase bacteria in the lake, and 48 hours is long enough for bacteria levels in the lake water to drop or dissipate to ensure that the beach water is again safe enough for swimming.” On Tuesday, thunderstorms brought heavy rainfall within three hours, causing widespread flooding across the city. According to Environment Canada, 97.6 millimetres of rain fell, which is more than a month’s worth of precipitation . In July, Toronto usually receives around 75 millimetres of rain.

15," Former public safety minister Marco Mendicino is calling for the creation of ""protective zones"" around political constituency offices to shield members of Parliament and their staff from a rising tide of threatening behaviour. Mendicino, a Toronto Liberal MP, said under the plan anyone who intimidated or otherwise harassed people within the buffer zone of perhaps 50 to 100 metres would be subject to harsher criminal penalties including jail time. In an interview, Mendicino suggested spelling out such zones in regulations that will flow from the recently passed foreign interference bill, which contains new measures to protect essential infrastructure. The former minister's comments come as the attempted assassination of ex-U.S. president Donald Trump prompts renewed concern and discussion about the safety of Canadian politicians. ""We have to take parliamentary security more seriously,"" Mendicino said. ""We need as Canadians to open our eyes and recognize that political violence is not something that just occurs somewhere else, but that it is happening here in our own communities."" People have constitutional rights to express a point of view and disagree with fellow Canadians including parliamentarians, he said. ""But it's also true that we're seeing more threats, more intimidation, more harassment, which can lead to harm both online and in the community."" In the last few years, several MPs from different parties have had their constituency offices targeted, including graffiti spray-painted on the exterior and rocks thrown through windows. Mendicino says he has received ""a barrage of death threats"" and that his family has also been targeted. A man recently spat on the MP in Ottawa as he walked to his office. He and his constituency staff have become more prudent about booking appointments with members of the public, devoting more effort to vetting and screening. Housing Minister Sean Fraser says he, too, has received death threats. ""My home has been outfitted with a greater degree of security than I feel is ordinary or that I'm personally even comfortable with,"" he said in an interview. ""But when security officials tell you they need to make certain decisions in your best interest when it comes to personal safety and security, you listen to them."" Police have provided more protection to federal politicians from various parties in recent years. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said this week he worries about his family's safety, and that he had sought protection in response to menacing behaviour. Mendicino, who was minister responsible for the national police force from October 2021 to July last year, said he ""always found that the RCMP were prepared to step up."" ""But it's my view that they continue to need more resources, that local law enforcement needs more resources, and that we should leave all options on the table when it comes to creating new authorities for them"" to help prevent harassment, he added. RCMP commissioner Mike Duheme recently said he wanted the government to look at drafting a new law that would make it easier for police to pursue charges against people who threaten elected officials. However, Justice Minister Arif Virani subsequently suggested existing Criminal Code provisions were sufficient. Mendicino said the government needs to press social media companies to do more to ensure online spaces are free of invective and harassment. He also acknowledges ""politicians need to look in the mirror themselves."" ""And I don't think it's particularly helpful to point fingers and say one party is more guilty of of engaging in extreme rhetoric than the other. I think we've got a collective responsibility to raise the bar of political debate,"" he said. Overall, he worries ""that the trends are all moving in the wrong direction."" Unless the problem is taken seriously, it will spur more political violence and make it harder to attract and retain good people in politics, Mendicino added. ""I'm going to continue to speak out on this issue to prevent that from happening.""

16," A massive rainstorm which flooded roads, basements and businesses in the city Tuesday is raising questions about Toronto's preparedness when it comes to major weather events. The storm, which dumped a month's worth of rain on the city in a matter of hours, overwhelmed sewer systems and waterways, causing damage and hampering transit. While such storms are rare, they are not unheard of. Another storm about a decade ago in 2013 caused major flooding, submerging vehicles and necessitating the rescue of passengers from a half-submerged GO Train. With more adverse weather expected due to climate change, the city has undertaken flood mitigation work over the past decade, including a massive project to reroute the mouth of the Don River to add flood protection in the Port Lands – a project which marked a major milestone just last week and which is expected to be compete by the end of this year. But the fact that the city has undertaken flood protection work over the past few years left some wondering why the city was then so overwhelmed by Tuesday's storm. Speaking on CTV Your Morning Wednesday, Mayor Olivia Chow said flood mitigation is at various stages of work in areas across the city, with some projects still waiting for dollars to flow. ""The west area, still some of those homeowners can't even get insurance for their basements because they've been flooding so much,"" Chow said. ""So we're waiting for the federal government to join us to really do flood mitigation measures in the west end of the city. It's about $300 million, and they've said yes, it's just we're waiting for the funds to flow."" Chow said the city also has ""very, very aggressive"" plans to build more housing in the East Harbour area, east of the Don River, but is also waiting on about $200 million from the federal government for flood protection. However she did note that Ottawa has contributed in a ""big"" way to flood protection with the project to naturalize the mouth of the Don River. One of the massive concrete ""plugs"" separating the newly-created stretch of river was removed last week. Once all of the plugs have been removed, the river will flow out through the new mouth, instead of emptying into the narrow Keating Channel. ""The last plug about to be pulled out in the next couple of months, that will allow the Don River to flow into Lake Ontario, and that would ease a lot of the flooding,"" Chow said. ""So it's happening, but we're almost there."" In a post, Waterfront Toronto confirmed that while a small amount of water from the Don River entered the new stretch of river, the project was not at a stage of completion that would have allowed water to flow through to the new mouth Tuesday. ""A small notch was also recently made at the west end of the North Plug to allow for construction of the riverbank where it meets the wall. Some water and debris flowed into the new river here, and the water level was a little higher than usual,"" Waterfront Toronto said in its post. ""Otherwise, the storm did not impact the construction site and increased waters from the Don River were still moving by way of the Keating Channel."" However the organization also noted that the project is not meant to protect all areas that were affected by Tuesday's flooding. ""The Port Lands Flood Protection project is designed to protect the Port Lands and portions of Leslieville and South Riverdale in a storm even bigger than yesterday's. It is not designed to mitigate flooding on the Don Valley Parkway, which remains within the Don River flood plain."" Speaking with CP24 Tuesday, Environment Canada Senior Climatologist Dave Phillips said that while the city might typically see one or two thunderstorms with heavy rain in a month, Tuesday brought three in quick succession and the infrastructure was not designed to cope. ""So huge amounts of rain and the system, the city infrastructure, couldn't take it. It was overworked. He pointed out that Toronto is ""a different city"" than it was about 20 or 30 years ago, with far more concrete surfaces and less green space that could absorb heavy rainfall. Chow reiterated Wednesday that the city has been looking at ways to encourage people not to pave their properties over with nonporous surfaces. ""We want to do more. For big parking lots, if it's just concrete, the water basically just runs off,"" Chow said. ""What we want them to do is have interlocking bricks, so that the water can seep into the ground, rather than just run off and flood everything else."" Earlier this year, staff proposed a separate tax be added to utility bills as a fixed charge, depending on the size of the paved area on a property.  The move led to cries that Toronto was trying to add a ""rain tax."" Chow directed staff to take another look following an outcry, but said at the time that it was important to have a plan that supports more green infrastructure, prevents flooding, and keeps water bills low.

17," Any Ontario strategy to end intimate partner violence must include more programs for men at risk of becoming perpetrators, an area in which the province is currently sorely lacking, experts told a committee Wednesday. There is a ""smattering"" of services available, said Katreena Scott, academic director of the Centre for Research and Education on Violence Against Women and Children at Western University, but it is too few and far between. ""The reality in Ontario is that we live, right now, in a system where if there is somebody who is engaging in — or is at risk for — hurtful, abusive or coercive behaviour, it's very, very difficult to find and get help,"" Scott told a legislative committee studying intimate partner violence. ""Really, what has to happen is they need to wait until they're involved in the criminal justice system."" The Progressive Conservative government said this spring that it would support an NDP bill to declare intimate partner violence an epidemic, but then-government house leader Paul Calandra also tasked the justice committee with a broader study of the issue. Those hearings began Wednesday. The move came nearly a year after the province rejected calls from an inquest into the deaths of three women at the hands of their former partner to make the declaration, saying it couldn't label intimate partner violence an epidemic because it was not an infectious or communicable disease. The jury at a coroner’s inquest into the 2015 deaths of Nathalie Warmerdam, Carol Culleton and Anastasia Kuzyk in Renfrew County made 86 recommendations aimed at preventing similar tragedies. One of those recommendations was to establish a 24-hour hotline for men who need support to prevent them from engaging in such violence, but the government has not yet acted on it. Experts at the legislative committee Wednesday held up an Alberta program as a good example of support for prevention, which offers men counselling, a 24-hour telephone support line, online resources and toolkits. Lana Wells, an associate professor at the University of Calgary and a domestic violence researcher, said men are predominantly the perpetrators of intimate partner violence and a provincial strategy to end it must include supports for them. ""When men and boys can emotionally self-regulate, embody gender-equitable norms and behaviours, have the skills to disrupt sexism, violence within themselves and their peers, embrace non-violence, have the skills to heal, repair and manage conflict, be accountable, and actively inspire their peers, colleagues and children to do the same, then we can stop violence before it starts,"" she told the committee. ""So what can Ontario do to advance this area? I think really focusing on removing the burden from victims and victimology and start to focus our attention on the people and systems that are causing harm."" Better data is also needed that can speak to prevention, Wells said, as most of the research in this area has focused on victims. There needs to be more information on any patterns that precede domestic violence and what factors can lead people to become perpetrators in order to disrupt those trajectories, she said. The Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services said it spent more than $350 million in the last fiscal year on services to address and prevent gender-based violence, including more than $10 million in violence-prevention initiatives. ""Everyone has the right to live free from fear, exploitation, intimidation, and the threat of violence,"" the ministry wrote in a statement. ""That is why our government is working to prevent intimate partner violence before it occurs."" This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 17, 2024.

18," Gen. Jennie Carignan was a little emotional on Thursday as she spoke to reporters about what it means to take over command of the Canadian Armed Forces. It's an honour that felt like the natural next step in her career, she said, something she's worked toward for the last 38 years. It also means, for other women or marginalized people, that ""it's possible, folks — the door is open."" ""This is actually what my parents used to tell me: 'Anything is possible. You can do anything,'"" she said. ""But I realized in 1986 that that was not necessarily true for everybody. Even if the doors were open, perceptions stay. There's unconscious biases that, frankly, I do have to question, myself, regularly."" Carignan became chief of the defence staff in a ceremony at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa on Thursday morning, taking over from Gen. Wayne Eyre, who is set to retire after three years in the job. ""I feel ready, poised and supported to take on this manifold challenge,"" Carignan said at the ceremony, with dignitaries including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Gov. Gen. Mary Simon looking on. ""So I embark on my tenure as your chief of defence staff with confidence. Confidence in our team, in our partners and in Canadians. We've got this,"" she said. There are some big challenges ahead for the Armed Forces and its new leader. Carignan said her first priority is recruiting more Canadians to join the military, and keeping existing troops in uniform. There are more than 16,000 vacant positions in the military, with shortfalls throughout its various ranks and professions. At the same time, more than 70,000 people applied to join the Armed Forces in the last year — but just over 4,300 actually got in. The government's defence policy says modernized recruitment processes are aimed at rebuilding the military by 2032. Carignan said she will start gathering her team to figure out how to make that happen faster. ""Recruiting personnel is a complex affair,"" she said. ""If we can get the momentum and get more people in, then sometimes it has a contagious effect."" For the last three years, Carignan led the office of professional conduct and culture, which was created as a result of the sexual misconduct scandal in 2021. Culture change is still ""at the heart of everything we do,"" she said, adding that in 2021, her office set a course to create ""irreversible change"" over five years. Carignan said she believes the military is still well on track to meet that target. ""We will always deal with misconduct, but it's how we navigate,"" she said. There is another five-year timeline she's thinking about, too. Carignan told reporters that based on talks with allies, she believes Canada has about five years to get ready to face a new set of threats — conventional military threats from adversaries like China, Russia and Iran, as well as emerging threats like disinformation. ""I think Canadians need to understand that if we are not ready, we might not be able to react appropriately in defence of them,"" she said. Defence Minister Bill Blair said his government feels a sense of urgency to get the Armed Forces the equipment it needs. His department has pledged to overhaul the notoriously slow and bureaucratic procurement system. ""We have to be ready to meet the moment,"" he said, cautioning that building new ships and planes is not a quick process. In his comments at the ceremony Eyre spoke about ""what could be existential threats,"" and said Canada has a history of being unprepared at the outset of wars. ""The security situation out there is not getting any better and we will continue to face many crises, often stacked one upon the other,"" he said. ""To do our part in the free world, we need to be at our own peak capability and readiness, and thus peak deterrence, to meet that threat."" Carignan brings ""highly relevant experience"" to her role, Eyre said. He told her in French: ""You are ready for this role, and you deserve it."" She was the first woman to command a combat unit in the Canadian military, and her career has included deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Syria. Following the formal handover of power, Trudeau thanked Eyre, saying he was ""the exact right person to help lead Canada through incredibly difficult times."" He praised Carignan as someone of the right calibre to take over, and pointed out she is the first woman to lead the military of any G20 country. ""You've demonstrated time and time again the ability to lead with both strength and flexibility,"" Trudeau said. ""You've shown a tremendous sense of agility, vision and courage.""

19," Republicans criticized U.S. President Joe Biden's record on foreign policy at the national convention in Milwaukee, as many party faithful called for America to step back from its contributions to the world. Wednesday's agenda and its theme of ""Make America Strong Once Again"" will give leaders around the world insight into the potential impact of a second Donald Trump presidency. ""No NATO. I want America strong,"" said Kimberly Nguyen, wearing a star-spangled dress and draped in a Trump 2024 flag outside the convention. Trump, who was officially confirmed as the Republican presidential candidate on Monday, has mused about increased tariffs, been critical of aid to Ukraine and repeatedly claimed he would not defend NATO members that don't meet defence spending targets, of which Canada is one. During a NATO leaders' summit in Washington last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to meet the spending target, which is the equivalent of two per cent of gross domestic product, by 2032. However, he has been criticized for the lengthy timeline and the lack of detail on how Ottawa will make it happen. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who is riding high in the polls, would not commit to the alliance's spending target, saying he doesn't make promises he can't keep. Trudeau faced a push from provincial leaders to speed up the spending timeline during a premiers' meeting in Halifax earlier Wednesday. Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew expressed concerns that failing to meet the target could jeopardize Canada's trading relationship with the U.S., particularly if there is a change in administration. Outside the Republican convention, there was little empathy for Canada's defence spending delay. Trump supporter Amy Lee said she supports the defensive alliance, but members must meet their commitments. ""Trudeau, we need you to pay your fair share to NATO,"" Lee said. All member countries directly contribute to the alliance's operations at an agreed-upon formula, and Canada pays its required share of that. Canada is one of about a dozen members that are not reaching the two per cent of GDP threshold for defence spending, though only seven members, including the U.S., spend more than Canada in real dollars. Top diplomats from around the world are at the convention to make inroads ahead of a possible second Trump presidency and to push Republicans away from some pledges the former president has made about defence alliances and trade. Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., said some Republicans have an isolationist bent. Many others, she said, understand that “America cannot be strong without having strong alliances.” “There is no singular voice on foreign policy as it relates to a number of issues at this point in the Republican Party,"" Hillman said in Milwaukee. Trump isn't officially scheduled to speak at the convention until Thursday, but has appeared each night of the convention, his right ear covered in a white bandage after it was pierced by a bullet when a man with an assault weapon fired from a rooftop near a rally Saturday afternoon. A rally attendee was killed and two others critically injured, before the gunman was shot dead by a member of the Secret Service. Wednesday was the first opportunity for Trump's running mate JD Vance to introduce himself to the world and he used his time to praise the former president, criticize Biden's foreign policy and highlight how disagreements can make the Republican party stronger. ""We will make sure our allies share in the burden of securing world peace. No more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer,"" Vance said. The 39-year-old Ohio senator has built a reputation during his short time in politics for fighting against current U.S. foreign policy and aid to Ukraine. Vance argued against further funding to the war-ravaged country in a column for the New York Times in April, and told the Munich Security Conference earlier this year that he was there to deliver a ""wake-up call"" that America's interests must come first. Trudeau has been one of the most outspoken NATO leaders in support of Ukraine, including at last week's leaders' summit. Vans with screens on the side were driving around the entrances of the convention Wednesday, displaying calls for Republicans to stand with Ukraine. The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, which funded the mobile messaging, said that was intended to remind Republicans that standing with Ukraine helps to defeat America's enemies. Hillman said Vance has some views on international and domestic policy that do not align with ""Canadian values in some circumstances and certainly our government policy in others."" But, she said, Vance represents Ohio, which has a massive trading relationship with Canada. More than a third of the state's exports go to Canada. “Having someone with that understanding of the importance of the Canada-U.S. economic relationship is a good thing for Canada.” The vice president pick also has a Canadian connection: Jamil Jivani, the recently elected Conservative MP for Durham, has called Vance his best friend from Yale.

21," A Toronto woman is looking to recover the specialized bicycle used to raise money for cancer research after it was stolen from her Etobicoke home over the weekend. Monica Doedens said she returned home on Saturday to find the lock on her door broken, her house ransacked and several valuable items stolen. The hardest loss to accept was her Pinarello bike, stored in the basement — purchased three years ago. “I could feel my heart drop,” Doedens told CTV News Toronto. “We have a garage and a shed, and I deliberately do not keep [the bike] in either because I thought the house was safest.” “The bicycle was an expensive one which I really didn’t think it could afford but because I ride so much I decided to spend the extra money on this bike and it was a little bit heartbreaking,” she continued. Doedens said the bike was custom-made and will cost $10,000 to replace. She said she doesn’t know yet if her home insurance will cover the loss. “They don’t make the Pinarello Prince anymore,” she said. “It’s very light and very maneuverable. It just feels good when I ride, and I ride a long way.” A cancer stem cell researcher by profession, Doedens has taken part in the Ride to Conquer Cancer — a two-day, 200 km cycling event — since its inception for the last 17 years. “And I’ve been doing cancer research since 1986 so it’s near and dear to my heart to raise this money, and so far I’ve raised $90,000 over those years, so I’m hoping to reach $100,000 next year.” Toronto Police stats show about 3,000 bikes are stolen a year. Last year, most were taken from outside residences. Doedens had been riding the stolen bike for nearly three years and misses it. She’s been scouring resale sites, speaking with neighbours and local shops in the hopes someone spots her beloved wheels. “Going down the hills, I know what to do to handle it, how it breaks, how it turns, that’s what I’m going to miss,” she said. “Fingers are crossed someone is going to see it.” ",1965,355," Monica Doedens returned home on Saturday to find the lock on her door broken and her house ransacked .

22," The brother of a New Zealand man who died after ordering a product from an accused Canadian suicide salesman says it shouldn’t be so easy for vulnerable people to get dangerous substances online. Sean Plunket says he’s shocked at how easily his brother, James, ordered the fatal package from Canada, and has tough questions for this country’s internet regulators and e-commerce platforms about why they didn't stop it. “The idea he could access this, not necessarily through the dark web, but it was there, hiding in plain bloody sight, that is chilling to me,” Plunket said in an interview from New Zealand. “We know he was vulnerable at that moment. At that moment he needed protection, there was someone who took advantage of him and made it easier for him to take his own life rather than harder,” he said. “Those bad decisions become very, very easy when you’ve got someone making money off it,” he said. A New Zealand coroner found this week that Plunket’s brother James was one of four people who died after ordering products from Kenneth Law, a former engineer and chef who lived in Mississauga. Those deaths push a CTV News tally of worldwide deaths associated with items sold online by Law to 129. Plunket, a broadcaster in New Zealand, said his brother James was a DJ and personal trainer whose businesses and marriage suffered in the COVID-19 pandemic. “He was smart as a tack. Loved to party, loved to laugh,” Plunket said. The report said Plunket ordered a package from Canada in June 2022, from a site “police have confirmed is connected with Kenneth Law.” About two weeks later, the 40-year-old died in a hotel room, with packaging connected to Law’s business next to him, the report says. Records show at least some of Law’s websites were hosted on the Canadian e-commerce platform Shopify, which powers a variety of online marketplaces. The company has said, after Law was arrested in 2023, they shut down his accounts. Police said at the time Law sent some 1,200 packages to 40 countries. A Shopify spokesperson said, “Once we were notified about a potential violation of our Acceptable Use Policy, we immediately reviewed and took action to terminate all stores associated with Kenneth Law.” Law is facing charges of first-degree murder and aiding and abetting suicide in 14 cases in Ontario. He has denied the charges. His lawyer has pointed out that he was selling a legal substance. Law’s products were promoted on a suicide discussion forum that CTV News is not naming. There’s no tool in Canadian law currently to ban websites. But that suicide forum could be caught up in the Online Harms Act, which is in second reading on Parliament Hill. The law would prohibit certain websites from offering content that would encourage young people to die by suicide. The website’s operators have told CTV News they “don’t care about Canadian law.” In a speech motivating the bill in June, Canadian Justice Minister Arif Virani said the Online Harms Act was necessary to protect Canadians against online bullying and hate. “It terrifies me that the most popular toys in my house, the screens, are not subject to any safety standards right now,” he said. Sarah Kennell of the Canadian Mental Health Association said she hopes Canada’s laws will follow in the footsteps of New Zealand, which moved to ban access to the forum and to Law’s websites.

25," Toronto has a special place in Hugh Jackman's heart. During an exclusive interview with Etalk in front of dozens of fans gathered in the parking lot of 299 Queen Street West on Tuesday, the Australian actor shared that the city was where his Wolverine journey began. ""I'm going to tell you a true story. We came in this morning. And I was driving here down that freeway. What is that freeway? (Someone in the audience shouts, 'Gardiner') On the left, they've got flowers with words. I was looking at it, and I just remembered 1999 October coming here to audition in Toronto for the character of Wolverine, 25 years ago,"" Jackman said. The actor, along with Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds and Canadian director Shawn Levy, was in Toronto on Tuesday to promote their film Deadpool & Wolverine , which is set to hit theatres on Friday. Reynolds, who plays Deadpool, shared his excitement for the film because he said it will be the first time the two characters enter the Marvel Cinematic Universe. ""We also have two Canadian-born superheroes. That's kind of a wild thing, you know,"" he said. According to Marvel, Wolverine is from Alberta, while Deadpool is from an ""unrevealed location"" in Canada. During the interview, Reynolds was also asked about his friendship with Jackman, describing their relationship as ""two old ladies watching the sunset."" ""The key thing with any friendship or partnership, this could be a friend or a spouse or anything, is rooting for the other person,"" the actor said. He recalled first meeting the Australian actor during the filming of X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2008 and saw how Jackman treated everybody on set with dignity, class and kindness. ""I remember at the end of my first day, he walked over to ask me how it went, and I didn't know him. He was a big star, I was playing a supporting role, and I said, 'I wish I could go back and shoot that scene over again. I didn't love it, but we're all good, we'll move on.' This guy fires up all the lights, tells everyone to get back in their wardrobe, get back on the set, and we shot it again, and that's what's in the movie,"" Reynolds said. ""I remember thinking, if I'm ever lucky enough to be in that guy's shoes, that's the kind of fella I'd love to be if I'm ever fortunate enough to have that. So that was my first impression of Jackman,"" he added before quipping, ""It's downhill from there, but it's mostly up."" The Etalk special hosted by Tyrone Edwards will air on CTV on Wednesday evening and stream later on Crave. Later in the evening, the trio attended the Canadian premiere of the movie at Scotiabank Theatre and met with fans, some of whom came as far as London, Ont. who had been waiting since this morning. Speaking to CP24 on the red carpet, Reynolds said it was ""essential"" that the movie also got a Canadian premiere. ""Of course, we're coming to Canada. And it's my mothership, this movie and this character, and Canada is my other mothership, so there's no way we would have missed it,"" he said. Reynolds, one of the writers and producers of the movie, has portrayed the current iteration of Deadpool since 2016. The actor called the story of Deadpool ""one of the greatest loves of my life."" ""Deadpool's always kind of character over spectacle, and character's the thing that I think you remember most,"" he said. ""All the surprises in the movie are character-based."" In a separate red carpet interview with CTV News Toronto, Reynolds said making the movie was a dream come true. Meanwhile, Jackman praised his co-star, saying Reynolds has a great work ethic and is ""generous"" as a writer, producer, and actor in the film. ""You guys should be so proud of him, and I hope you're as proud of this movie as we are,"" Jackman said. The Australian actor, who has played the mutant for more than two decades, is excited for fans to see him in Wolverine's iconic blue and yellow suit. ""I'm losing my mind. I can't believe for 24 years I didn't put on the yellow and blue,"" Jackman said, sharing that Reynolds informed him when he agreed to do the movie that Wolverine would don the yellow-and-blue costume. ""As soon as I put it on, it all made sense. And now I actually sleep with the costume."" Reynolds quipped that he told Jackman to steal the costume after the movie. ""And I did,"" the Australian actor said. -- CP24 and CTV are divisions of Bell Media.

28," The province’s police watchdog is investigating after a man was seriously injured when he was shot by a Toronto police officer in Cabbagetown Tuesday evening. The incident occurred near Carlton and Parliament streets at around 7:14 p.m. Toronto police said a man was armed with a knife, and an officer discharged their firearm. The man was transported to the hospital in serious, potentially life-threatening condition, Toronto paramedics said. It is unclear what led to the shooting. Because the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) has invoked its mandate, Toronto police said no further details would be released about the incident. A resident in the area told CP24 he was having dinner when he heard “a few loud bangs,” which he initially thought were fireworks.

29," WEST ALLIS, Wisconsin (AP) — A roaring crowd of battleground state voters greeted Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday as she opened her public case against Republican former President Donald Trump by declaring November's election will be ""a choice between freedom and chaos.” “In this campaign, I promise you, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week,” Harris said. “We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead.” Harris arrived in the Milwaukee area having locked up nomination support from Democratic delegates after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid on Sunday. It was her first campaign rally since she jumped into the race just two days ago with Biden’s endorsement. The event reflected a vibrancy that had been lacking among Democrats in recent weeks, and Harris was intent on projecting a sense of steady confidence about the November election. She's pulled in $100 million in donations since Sunday afternoon and on Tuesday picked up the backing of more Democratic officials and political groups, including congressional leaders Charles Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries. By stopping in Wisconsin, Harris was putting down a marker in one of the “blue wall” states along with Michigan and Pennsylvania that Democrats see as essential for securing a presidential victory. The visit comes a week after the Republican National Convention wrapped up in the city and as Harris works to sharpen her message against the GOP nominee with just over 100 days until Election Day. Harris' trip to the state was a sharp contrast to Biden's July 6 visit, when he was trying to reassure Democrats who were wary after his troubling performance in the June 27 debate against Trump. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is up for reelection this year, had skipped the Biden event, but she spoke before Harris on Tuesday. Harris is leaning into her resume as a former district attorney and California attorney general, seeking to draw a contrast with Trump who is the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes. “She’s prepared to meet this moment because she was professionally trained to prosecute a criminal, and unfortunately that’s who the Republicans have put forward,” said Sen. Laphonza Butler, D-Calif. Harris strode onto the stage Tuesday to the anthem “Freedom” from Beyonce’s “Lemonade” album and set about contrasting herself with Trump. “I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators who abused women. Fraudsters who ripped off consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type,” she said. Harris cast her campaign as a “people first” endeavor, again aiming to draw a contrast with Trump, who she said represented special interests and corporations. She also portrayed her rival’s policies as being antiquated and backward looking. “We are not going back,′ she said. “And I’ll tell you why we are not going back. Ours is a fight for the future.” That echoed Barack Obama who frequently deployed the refrain during his 2012 reelection fight to argue against Republican ideas. Harris' swift ascent over the past few days has required her to vet possible running mates, a process being led by Eric Holder, who was attorney general during Barack Obama's presidency. But her key impact so far has been galvanizing Democrats. Before the Tuesday speech, Diane Walter, 68, of South Milwaukee said she was thrilled that Harris is the candidate. “I’ve been a Democrat my whole life,"" Walter said. ""She’s energizing the party again.” Tevin Humphrey, 21, came with his mother Myeesha Johnson, 41, and described the vice president as “a great figure to look up to.” “She’s a better representative of the diversity we’re looking for,” he said. Trump and his campaign have quickly turned most of their focus on Harris and have asserted that they were prepared for the change and it did not alter their plans. The former president has nicknamed the vice president “Lyin’ Kamala Harris,” accused her of not being tough enough on crime as a prosecutor and sought to bind her to the administration’s policies on the border as he seeks to make immigration a focus of his campaign. But there are signs that Trump seems to be unhappy about facing the younger vice president rather than making his case against the aging president. Twice since Biden dropped out, Trump has said the planned second presidential debate should not be hosted by ABC News and suggested it be moved to Fox News, which has a perception of being friendlier to him. Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, at an appearance in Washington, said he was unimpressed by Trump's attacks, telling reporters Tuesday, “That’s all he’s got?” In addition to Baldwin, Harris was joined by major elected officials in Wisconsin, including Gov. Tony Evers, Attorney General Josh Kaul, Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski and Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler. Republican leaders in Wisconsin, for their part, branded Harris as an “extreme liberal” who is out of step with most voters in the swing state. "" Kamala Harris’ favorables are as bad as Joe Biden’s,” said Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming at a news conference ahead of the Harris event at a high school outside of Milwaukee. “So they are exchanging one bad candidate for another bad candidate in the hope that the people of this state and this country don’t notice where she actually stands on the issues.” -- Associated Press writer Josh Boak reported from Washington. AP writers Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin and Michelle L. Price in New York contributed.

30," A sentencing hearing is expected to begin today in Toronto for former fashion mogul Peter Nygard, who was found guilty of four counts of sexual assault last fall. The sentencing process has been delayed in part because Nygard's two previous defence lawyers, Brian Greenspan and Megan Savard, asked to withdraw from the case earlier this year. Nygard, who once led a multimillion-dollar clothing empire, has also faced health challenges throughout the case, and his health is expected to be raised during sentencing submissions. He was found guilty on four counts of sexual assault on Nov. 12, but was acquitted of a fifth count, as well as a charge of forcible confinement. The charges relate to allegations dating from the 1980s until the mid-2000s. Nygard is also facing charges in two other provinces and the United States. His Manitoba trial on sexual assault-related charges has been delayed in part due to Greenspan's resignation as his defence lawyer in that case as well as the Toronto one. Nygard, who is in his 80s, also faces one count of sexual assault and one count of forcible confinement in Quebec. He was first arrested in Winnipeg in 2020 under the Extradition Act after he was charged with nine counts in New York, including sex trafficking and racketeering charges. In May, Manitoba's highest court dismissed Nygard's application for a judicial review of his extradition order, finding there was no reason to interfere with the order issued by then-justice minister David Lametti. None of the criminal charges against Nygard in Quebec, Manitoba or the U.S. have been tested in court, and he has denied all allegations against him.

The City of Toronto urges caution over third-party payment companies Share Whether it's for parking, speeding or running a red light, no one likes being issued a traffic ticket, but it’s important to be careful how you pay them. Richmond Hill resident Xiaoying Yang said she was issued a traffic ticket for $325 from a red light camera last October. Download our app to get alerts on your device Get the latest local updates right to your inbox “Sometimes if you Google something, you have to be careful because you can't tell which is which,” Yang said. About to travel to China for six months, she said she Googled how to find a way to pay the ticket before her departure date. “I was leaving for China very soon so I did an internet search and decided to use a third-party website to help me pay,” Yang said. After finding a company that added a processing fee, she paid a total of $335 with her credit card. However, when Zang returned to Canada six months later, she found out the ticket hadn’t been paid. “They didn't pay the money to the city. So I want my money back,” Yang said. If you Google ‘paying a traffic ticket,’ you may see multiple third-party companies that offer services for an added fee. These websites may pay your ticket without any issues, but according to the City of Toronto, they are not necessary as payments can be made directly through the city’s website. The director of Toronto Court Services told CTV News that the city is not affiliated with third-party online payment platforms accepting payments for tickets, early resolutions or trial requests. “Residents are advised to be cautious. Payment or disputes can only be made directly through the city’s online portal.” When CTV News Toronto reached out to the company Yang contracted to pay her ticket, it claimed Yang had not followed the proper procedures and was difficult to reach when she was in China for six months. However, after being contacted by CTV News, the company issued Yang a full refund. “This is such a relief to get my money back and I am glad it was done in swift fashion after contacting CTV,” said Yang. If you get a ticket for running a red light or a photo radar ticket for speeding, no demerit points are given as these tickets are for the owner of the vehicle and not the driver so it won't affect your car insurance premiums.

36," KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — A plane crashed Wednesday just after taking off from Nepal’s capital, killing 18 people and injuring a pilot who was the lone survivor. All the people aboard the Saurya Airlines flight including the co-pilot were Nepali except for one passenger, who was a Yemeni national, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said. Authorities have pulled all 18 bodies from the wreckage, police official Basanta Rajauri said. The Bombardier CRJ 200 plane was heading to Nepal's second-most populous city of Pokhara for maintenance work and most of the passengers aboard were either mechanics or airline employees, airport officials said. They were speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters. The pilot has injuries to his eyes but his life is not in any danger, said a doctor at Kathmandu Medical College Hospital, where the pilot is being treated. The doctor spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak to reporters. The plane took off from the Kathmandu airport at 11:11 a.m. local time and turned right but crashed moments later in the eastern section of the airport, the Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement. “I came out and saw a plane had crashed and there was huge smoke and fire coming out,"" said Ram Kumar Khatri Chetri, who own a car parts store barely 100 meters (330 feet) from the crash site. ""There was chaos and confusion.” “It was just horrible and there was no way that anyone could just go near the plane and help out when there was so much fire and even explosions,” he said. It is the monsoon rain season in Kathmandu but was not raining at the time of the crash. Visibility was low across the capital, however. The Kathmandu airport, the main airport serving Nepal, is inside a valley surrounded by mountains that make takeoffs and landings challenging for pilots. The airport is right next to the city, and is surrounded by houses and neighborhoods. The bodies have been taken to the T.U. Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu for autopsy. The airline manifest showed there were two pilots and 17 passengers on board. Grieving relatives gathered at the hospital forensics department to collect the bodies of their loved ones, though they are not likely to be released for a day or two. The co-pilot Sasant Katuwal had been flying only for the past three years after completing training in France, his uncle Dhyan Bahadur Khadka said at the hospital. He had just received a visa to go to Germany for further training and was excited about that, Khadka said. Khadka said his nephew had a bright future in aviation. “His parents are grieving the loss of their only child,"" Khadka said. “He was unmarried. He was not just tall and handsome, but he was well behaved,” Tribhuvan International Airport, the main airport in Nepal for international and domestic flights, was closed for hours as emergency crew and investigators began their work. Saurya Airlines operates the Bombardier CRJ 200 on domestic routes. In 2019, a Bangladeshi airliner crashed at Tribhuvan airport, killing 51 people while 20 on board survived. An investigation confirmed the plane was misaligned with the runway and its pilot was disoriented and tried to land in “sheer desperation” when the plane crashed. In 2015, a Turkish Airlines jet landing in dense fog skidded off a slippery runway at the airport. The plane was carrying 238 people but there were no serious injuries.

38," A convicted sex offender who allegedly hid the body of a vulnerable individual in a Toronto apartment is now wanted on additional charges, police announced on Wednesday. Rejean Hermel Perron, 52, is still at large after investigators identified him as a suspect in an indignity to a human body investigation last month. Police allege in that case that Perron befriended a resident of the city’s Riverside neighbourhood and took “deliberate steps” to keep their body hidden in their apartment after they died. Police said that the deceased, who has not been identified, died of natural causes and was frequently seen with the accused before their death. Their body was discovered on May 27 and police said Perron was forensically linked to the scene. Perron was also observed using the deceased's key fob to enter the apartment, police added. In a news release issued Wednesday, police said that Perron is now facing four new charges, including sexual assault, assault, uttering threats and forcible confinement, after investigators received additional information following the June 26 news conference. READ MORE: Suspect who allegedly concealed dead body in Toronto apartment identified Police told CTV News Toronto that the new charges stem from an incident in the ‘90s. “Police continue to look for this suspect, and are still seeking the public to come forward with any information,” a Toronto police spokesperson said in an email. Suspect may be 'exploiting' additional vulnerable individuals: police In 2015 , Perron was charged and later convicted of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a sex trade worker. At the time, police said that the victim was held against her will in an east-end home for five days before she was able to break free and run to safety. Police also said that there was some “form of ritualistic action"" involved in the 2015 crime, but did not elaborate. Prior to the June news conference, Perron was wanted on a Canada-wide warrant for breaching the conditions of his parole related to that conviction in 2021. Supt. Kim O'Toole of 55 Division said there had been ""no sign"" of Perron for a number of years until the body was discovered on May 27. “Police are deeply concerned that he may be sustaining himself by exploiting vulnerable individuals as he did in this case,” O'Toole said at the time, adding that investigators believe Perron poses a particular threat to women and members of the LGBTQ2S+ community. She said investigators believe Perron is still in the Toronto area and is known to frequent the downtown’s east side. He has also spent time in Kingston and Chatham-Kent, Ont. Perron is described by police as five-foot-seven to five-foot-10 inches tall, with dark hair, blue eyes, a thin build and a possibly pock-marked face. He may also be using the aliases Daniel Joseph Christie, Kristy, or Krysty, police said. “We believe people have seen Perron and in particular we are seeking help form those people who work with vulnerable people in these communities,” O’Toole said. Perron was serving a three-year sentence at Bath Institution, near Kingston, Ont., prior to his release in 2021. O’Toole said Perron left Bath without any government ID and he does not have any bank accounts listed in his name. To that end, O’Toole said police have no way of tracking him. “We don’t know how he’s supporting himself. We suspect that he is preying on vulnerable individuals to make his way through life while he is wanted on this Canada-wide warrant,” she said.

39," The Ontario government says it is giving Toronto $73 million in order to speed up rehabilitation work on the latest stretch of the Gardiner Expressway by a year. Work on the expressway between Dufferin and Strachan was scheduled to be complete by April 2027, but the money will be used to carry out construction 24/7 so that it's done by April 2026. Ontario Transportation Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria made the announcement alongside Mayor Olivia Chow Wednesday morning at city hall. ""Ontario's investment will support contractors working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with multiple shifts per day, with additional measures supported through this agreement to improve traffic flow,"" Sarkaria said. He said additional measures will include modification of the Jameson Avenue on-ramp to the westbound Gardiner and opening a left turn lane at Spadina Avenue from Lake Shore East Boulevard, as well as relaxing noise restrictions and overnight lane closures. ""I am pleased to say that with the support of Minister Sakara and the provincial government, we are able to bring a plan to council that would accelerate the reconstruction of the Gardiner by one year,"" Chow said. ""We are very grateful for their partnership."" Construction work to rehabilitate the crumbling expressway between Dufferin Street and Strachan Avenue has hampered traffic since it started in April. Drivers have described 'nightmare' commute times with the busy expressway squeezed down to just two lanes of traffic in each direction since then, prompting calls for the work to be sped up. Data released last month suggested that some commute times during the morning rush hour have increased by up to 250 per cent since the work began. ""Right now we are demolishing and rebuilding that stretch of elevated highway while four lanes of traffic continue to be driving on it. It's really complex,"" Chow said. However she added that ""no one wants to be stuck in traffic. It's frustrating. It gets your blood pressure, especially when you see a lane closure where, apparently there's no work being done."" Sarkaria said he uses the Gardiner every day himself and has seen travel times increase ""Commuting into Queens Park, I can tell you, it's added almost 40-45, minutes to my drive into the city,"" he said, adding he can appreciate that it's doing the same for many other people. The province estimates the plan will save Ontario's economy $273 million by reducing gridlock. While the province is kicking in $73 million to speed up the work, it was not immediately clear what the full cost will be. ""The financial details will be shared once the contracts are negotiated and finalized by our contractors,"" Chow said. ""But I am pleased that the province has stepped in to help finance this acceleration. The people of Toronto want their government to repair the Gardiner as quickly as possible."" Sarkaria said incentive structures for contractors will ensure that the work is completed on-schedule. ""So if those timelines are not met, they're not going to get the incentivization payments to complete this project,"" he said. Asked about noise considerations for residents who live in the area, Spadina-Fort York Councillor Ausma Malik said the approach to residents' concerns has been ""thoughtful"" so far in terms of testing out noisier construction to match their needs. ""The commitment has been to ensure that folks are able to get a good night's rest, even in our busy downtown communities, and I've been confident that that consideration is going to be taken forward as the 24/7 work that has always kind of been possible here is further accelerated,"" she said. She said the city plans to ""stay on top of ensuring that any noise issues are addressed quickly"" and being proactive to ensure that residents aren't affected as badly they were in the first stage of Gardiner rehabilitation in the eastern part of the city. Approximately 140,000 vehicles use the busy expressway each day. The work being done now is the second part of a long-term rehabilitation plan for the crumbling 60-year-old expressway, which is being carried out in six stages. Council approved the plan back in 2014. The first stretch, between Jarvis and Cherry streets, was completed in 2021. Four more stages remain to be done after the current stage is complete.

40," Two people are dead and two others suffered serious injuries following a shooting that police have described as a “gun battle” outside a plaza in Scarborough early Wednesday morning. Shots rang out in the parking lot of a plaza in the area of Ellesmere Road and Oakley Boulevard, near Midland Avenue, shortly after 2:30 a.m. Speaking to reporters at the scene on Wednesday, Det. Rod Benson said a “significant” number of shots were fired during what appears to be an exchange of gunfire. One male was pronounced dead at the scene and a female later died in hospital. Two other males were transported to a trauma centre to be treated for serious injuries. Police did not provide information on the ages of the victims. Benson could not say exactly how many shots were fired, noting that as of 9:30 a.m., forensic officers were still finding new shell casings. “Several hours after the fact, they are still in the process of finding them and marking them so that they can be photographed,” Benson said. He said one firearm was located at the scene but it is unclear if the weapon belonged to any of the victims. “It certainly appears to have been a gun battle,” Benson said. “At this point, we don’t have any suspect information. That will be something we will be able to provide probably later today or possibly tomorrow.” He urged anyone who witnessed the incident or has dash camera footage to contact investigators. “We are beginning a very robust video canvas. So we will be searching for video and speaking to witnesses,” Benson added. He said he expects officers will be on scene at the plaza for most of the day. ""We understand that incidents like this, where people are shot, people are killed, create a significant concern for members of the community,"" Duty Insp. Todd Jocko told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. ""Please know that we are dedicating all necessary resources to this investigation and the residents can expect to see an increased police presence in the area for the time being."" Jocko conceded that rain that began to fall on Wednesday afternoon is not ideal as investigators continue to process the evidence. ""Certainly rain is a factor when we are doing any kind of investigation on scene,"" he said, adding that officers have had a considerable amount of time to process the scene already.

The Bank of Canada cut its key interest rate for a second consecutive time on Wednesday, but warned the path back to two per cent inflation may be uneven and would ultimately determine the pace of future rate cuts The central bank says its decision to lower its policy rate by a quarter percentage point was motivated by easing price pressures and weakening economic conditions.

In his prepared statement, governor Tiff Macklem noted that as inflation edges closer to target, the central bank is also trying to avoid the risk of the economy and inflation weakening by more than expected. However, he said the path back to two per cent inflation likely won’t be a straight line. “The overall weakness in the economy is pulling inflation down. At the same time, price pressures in shelter and some other services are holding inflation up,” Macklem said. Although the governor said the Bank of Canada is “increasingly confident” that inflation is headed back to target, the push and pull between those opposing forces could affect the pace at which price growth eases. “If inflation continues to ease broadly in line with our forecast, it is reasonable to expect further cuts in our policy interest rate.

47," . OTTAWA — The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs criticized the federal government for reducing funds to search the grounds of former residential schools, saying in a statement they are profoundly disappointed and outraged. Communities could previously receive up to $ million per year through the Residential Schools Missing Children Community Support Fund, but funding will now be capped at $500,000. “The decision to cut back substantial funding for this critical initiative is not only disheartening but also disrespectful to the survivors and families affected by the residential school system,” said deputy grand chief Betsy Kennedy in a statement. “The search for truth and justice must go forward without further delays or federal roadblocks, especially when it concerns the lost lives of our children.” The chiefs sent a letter to Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Gary Anandasangaree asking for previous funding to be reinstated. Ottawa said the funds were reduced in order to take a “sustainable approach” that provides money to as many community-led projects as possible. The funding adjustments will not apply to previously signed agreements, a spokesperson for Crown-Indigenous Relations said in a statement Tuesday. The government also highlighted the $216 million it has put toward the community support fund since 2021. That fund was created in the wake of Tk’emlups te Secwépemc First Nation’s report in  of that year about 215 anomalies found on the grounds of a former residential school in Kamloops, B.C., reinvigorating the national conversation about the history and legacy of residential schools. Residential schools, often operated by the Catholic Church with support from the federal government, were used as a tool to assimilate Indigenous Peoples into settler society, ripping thousands of children away from their families and cutting them off from their culture and language. Dozens of reports from the period 1880 to 1996, when the schools operated, and afterward have highlighted the cruel fates of children in the institutions, including sexual and physical abuse, and, in some cases, death. Those findings, among others, are encapsulated in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s final report, released in 2015 after years of testimonies from survivors, community members and families. The commission called for a memorial register that would analyze information about missing children and deaths, as well as creation of a map of cemeteries and burial sites. Kennedy said the decision to cut funding without first speaking to First Nations leadership is a “missed opportunity” for Canada to strengthen relations and respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples. The identification and commemoration of unmarked graves is “essential in honouring those lost, who deserve to be brought home to rest in ceremony among their loved ones,” the assembly said. “Finding and recovering those who have died while attending residential schools is critical in healing our nations. It is also an important step in acknowledging the full extent of the atrocities committed within the residential school system.” Crown-Indigenous Relations spokesperson Carolane Gratton said residential schools are a “shameful” part of Canada’s history. Her statement also highlighted $ million in new money for the fund as outlined in this year’s budget. With the new funding model, Gratton said priority will be given to work that focuses on research, fieldwork in identifying potential burial sites and engagement with communities that have not yet begun research or fieldwork. The National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation also blasted the federal government for cuts, saying it broke its commitment to families and communities. “Communities engaged in the search process, and experts who have looked into the issue, have been saying that the federal funding mechanism is already too restrictive to properly meet real world needs,” executive director Stephanie Scott said in a release last week. “This arbitrary funding cap is a step in exactly the wrong direction for reconciliation.

MIRABEL, QUE. — The Quebec government is injecting another $413 million into the Airbus A220 commercial jet program, formerly known as the C Series, in a bid to improve its return on investment. The announcement Tuesday brings Quebec’s total investment in the program to more than $ billion, but Quebec Premier François Legault insists the move is a “good deal.” “It’s a lot of money, but at the same time, this is very strategic,” he said during a news conference at the Airbus assembly site in Mirabel, Que., northwest of Montreal. “We have been partners since the beginning.” France-based Airbus is investing $. billion in the program, and has guaranteed that two-thirds of the jobs involved in building the jets will remain in Quebec. The company currently employs ,000 people in the province, including ,500 involved with the production of the A220. The average salary of those jobs is $,500, Legault said — well above the provincial average. The investment maintains Quebec’s -per-cent share in the program and extends the timeline for Airbus to buy back its stake by five years, to 2035 from 2030. The injection of funds follows a previous government investment of $380 million in 2022, after Airbus put in $. billion. Former premier Philippe Couillard’s Liberal government funnelled $. billion into Bombardier’s C Series program in 2015, before it was purchased by Airbus in 2018. Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said he hopes the government will make back the money it’s put into the project since 2022, “and make some return on it.” Benoît Schultz, president and CEO of Airbus Canada, said he hopes to sell  aircraft per month and achieve profitability by 2026. The program has recently been affected by a problem with engines made by American aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney. The A220 jet is assembled in Mirabel and Mobile, Ala., and Schultz said Airbus had delivered  planes by the end of  this year. “The company may lose money right now, but this program is one of the best programs of Airbus,” Fitzgibbon said. “So far, the program is successful from a sales perspective … At the end of the day, the consumers like the product, and they buy it.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published .

50," . WHITEHORSE, YUKON — A Yukon mine inspector has ordered Victoria Gold to shore up its water treatment efforts, finding the company’s plan to clean up after a disastrous spill of cyanide-laced-rock and water last month at its Eagle Gold mine is insufficient. In an inspector’s direction issued  , mine inspector Sevn Bohnet said Victoria Gold was required to come up with a water treatment plan earlier this month, and the company submitted a pair of “unsigned memos” in response. The memos, the inspector’s direction says, don’t “sufficiently describe” the company’s ability to handle and treat the amount of contaminated water at the site, including its ability to source “large quantities of reagents,” the compounds or substances needed for the water treatment process. The company’s “groundwater interception plan” is also insufficient because it doesn’t describe how it would “effectively” intercept groundwater in the Dublin Gulch valley, the document says. About two million tonnes of ore spilled over an embankment in the heap leach facility at the mine site on  , resulting in a landslide . kilometres long and the escape of about 300 million litres of the cyanide solution. The mine had been using the cyanide solution to percolate through the crushed ore to extract gold. An earlier Yukon government direction issued to the company required Victoria Gold to build a water storage facility to hold up to ,000 cubic metres of contaminated water by  , but Bohnet’s latest direction says two days after that deadline, “a natural resource officer observed that no lined water storage facility had been constructed.” The direction orders the company to meet six new conditions, including not to discharge contaminated water that can’t be completely contained, to build more water treatment capacity and to provide “certainty” that it can treat between ,000 and ,000 cubic metres of contaminated water a day, among other conditions. “This series of additional directions is aimed at addressing potential stability risks of the heap leach facility, and enhancing contaminated water storage and treatment, which includes setting up a system to pump and treat groundwater,” Yukon Mines Minister John Streicker said in a statement Tuesday. “The Government of Yukon is applying a progressive enforcement approach to the Eagle Gold failure response,” the statement said. “The inspector’s directions issued on Saturday build on the previous ones and are based on our updated understanding of the site conditions and potential risks.” Randi Newton, conservation manager with the Yukon chapter of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, said Victoria Gold hasn’t come up with a “viable plan” to treat contaminated water at the site. “When I looked at the direction, what stood out to me is Victoria Gold’s complete and utter failure to respond in a capable way to this disaster,” Newton said. “I hope it signals that the Yukon government will step in in a more concerted way this week because the company can no longer be counted on to do so.” Newton said both the territorial and federal governments should take on a greater role and should treat the heap leach facility failure as “the emergency that it is.” She said the millions collected as security for the mine by the government accounted for an “orderly closure” of the Eagle Gold mine, rather than a catastrophic failure of its heap leach facility. “This is going to be very complex and very expensive,” Newton said. The company did not reply to emails or phone calls for comment on the inspector’s latest direction. Yukon officials said at a technical briefing last week that the government was “contemplating” stepping in at the mining site, and would convene an expert-led independent review to determine the cause of the disaster. In a public statement issued  , Victoria Gold said production at the mine has been suspended, and may never restart without government authorization. “Victoria will continue to work to minimize impacts to the environment, with the safety of employees as a foremost priority,” the statement said, adding that Victoria Gold may not “have the financial resources necessary to repair damage to equipment and facilities or remediate impacts caused by the incident or restart production.” — By Darryl Greer in Vancouver This report by The Canadian Press was first published .

51," . OTTAWA — Federal immigration officials warned the government it risked undermining the temporary immigration system with the design of the emergency visa program for war-displaced Ukrainians, newly released court documents show. Immigration Department staff raised the concern in a memo to Sean Fraser, immigration minister at the time, shortly after the program was announced. The memos outline the design of the Ukraine visa program, which allowed an unlimited number of Ukrainians and their family members to come to Canada to wait out the war. The policy also waived the requirement for fleeing Ukrainians to promise to leave when their visa expires, against the advice of department staff. “Waiving the need for a client to establish temporary intent would set a significant precedent that is not recommended, given that it would undermine a foundational component of the (temporary resident) legal framework,” staff said in the memo to Fraser, which was signed . Staff cautioned that waiving the requirement — the foundation of the temporary resident program — would set an “expectation that it could be done for other populations, not only those affected by conflict.” The documents were disclosed as part of a proposed lawsuit against the federal government by three Afghan Canadians, who allege Canada discriminated against Afghan refugees by treating them differently than it did Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion. The lawsuit hasn’t yet been certified by the court. “The government knew that what they were doing was unfair,” said Nicholas Pope, one of the lawyers representing the Afghan Canadians. “That’s just what we’re arguing in this case. That it’s unfair, it’s discriminatory, and there’s not a good reason why protections shouldn’t be applied to people who aren’t from Europe.” The lawsuit was filed by Canadians who served as language and culture advisers to the Canadian government and NATO during the war in Afghanistan, but haven’t been allowed to bring family members in Afghanistan to safety. Canada has approved some 962,600 emergency visas for Ukrainians since the 2022 Russian invasion, which allow people fleeing the conflict to work and study while the war rages. The program was generally well received in Canada, where people opened their homes to Ukrainians and donated clothes, furniture and other essentials to help them settle during their stay. Roughly 298,000 actually made the trip to Canada, though it’s unclear how many have stayed, and how many have since applied for permanent residency. The documents also warn the design of the program could disadvantage Ukrainians by effectively creating “second class” permanent residents, without access to settlement supports or equivalent status under the law. The government has argued the emergency program for Ukrainians can’t be compared to the program for Afghan refugees, because people from Afghanistan are unlikely to be able to return home. In the memo, though, staff say the key distinction between temporary programs and permanent ones is the requirement that visa holders declare their intention to leave. The department officials described the Ukraine emergency visa program as “exceptional in nature.” “It underscores Canada’s unique relationship with Ukraine, the extensive diaspora and family links, as well as the unique nature of the conflict as a significant land invasion adjacent to EU countries with generous immigration measures,” the memo reads. “However, it risks setting a significant precedent, one which may result in future pressures on the government to take similar action for other emergencies.” Two full pages of legal considerations outlined by the department were blacked out in the documents provided to the court. Fraser ultimately agreed with the department’s recommendation not to publish the policy publicly, given the “unprecedented and exceptional nature” of the approach. Pope seized on that point Tuesday. “Why would you not publish a policy if you’re proud of it, and you think that it’s fair, and you think that it’s just and you think that it’s Charter compliant?” he asked. “I think they really understood the problematic nature of this.” The offices of Fraser, now housing minister, and the current immigration minister, Marc Miller, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The government has emphasized that the Ukrainian program is intended to be temporary, and has encouraged those without family ties to Canada to apply for permanent residency through traditional means if they hope to stay. Since Fraser announced the visa program, the government has faced accusations of unfairly limiting temporary refuge to people attempting to flee conflicts in Sudan and the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. In  the Canadian Council for Refugees pointed out the disparity between the program for Ukrainians and the temporary refuge programs for Sudanese people. “The crisis in Sudan … is of catastrophic proportions,” the group wrote to Miller earlier this year. “Given the scale of the crisis, the limit of ,250 applications in the family-based humanitarian pathway is inadequate to the need. In contrast, Canada admitted an unlimited number of Ukrainians on temporary visas, and the pathway to permanent residence for Ukrainians is similarly without a cap.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published . Laura Osman, The Canadian Press ",5412,844,". OTTAWA — Federal immigration officials warned the government it risked undermining the temporary immigration system with the design of the emergency visa program for war-displaced Ukrainians, newly released court documents show. Immigration Department staff raised the concern in a memo to Sean Fraser, immigration minister at the time, shortly after the program was announced. The memos outline the design of the Ukraine visa program, which allowed an unlimited number of Ukrainians and their family members to come to Canada to wait out the war. The policy also waived the requirement for fleeing Ukrainians to promise to leave when their visa expires, against the advice of department staff. “Waiving the need for a client to establish temporary intent would set a significant precedent that is not recommended, given that it would undermine a foundational component of the (temporary resident) legal framework,” staff said in the memo to Fraser, which was signed. Staff cautioned that waiving the requirement — the foundation of the temporary resident program — would set an “expectation that it could be done for other populations",206,216,citynews,https://toronto.citynews.ca/2024/07/23/feds-were-warned-about-setting-significant-precedent-with-ukraine-visa-program/,news,allenai
52," . British Columbia’s child welfare system is either in a state of crisis or close to it with understaffing and unmanageable workloads, the province’s representative for children said. A report released by Jennifer Charlesworth Tuesday said the environment for social workers at the Ministry of Children and Family Development is unhealthy for staff, characterized by undue stress, burnout and fear, and there’s no time for the government to wait to address the “critical circumstances.” The latest investigation comes days after her report on the torture death of an -year-old boy who died at the hands of relatives after not being checked on by a social worker for seven months. Charlesworth said the boy’s death happened within the context of a child welfare office that was not fully staffed, had unstable and changing local leadership, and had an extended period of social worker medical leave with no backfill. Her office conducted a survey of 700 social workers and managers and more than  per cent said they are unable to properly do their jobs because their caseloads are too high. She said many reported not having enough supports or resources and not having places to turn to refer families in need. “If you can put yourself in the workers’ position here, you’re feeling you can’t fulfil your responsibility, and you can’t even refer out to fulfil your responsibility. That’s going to add to a tremendous amount of feeling of stress and overwhelm,” she said. Alan Markwart, the author of the report, told a news conference Tuesday that data from 2021 showed B.C. needed “several hundred” more social workers in order to meet their work requirements  per cent of the time. The government has stopped collecting that data, he said. “The ministry used to also track offices that were staffed at  per cent or less, but they stopped tracking that in 2022,” he said. “Both of those, in our view, are crucial metrics that … they should be gathering, but they don’t.” Children and Family Development Minister Grace Lore said at a news conference after the report was released that the number of staff doing front-line work has increased  per cent “in recent years” and 200 people have been added since . She said the ministry has created a mentorship program and has a remote team to help with administrative tasks so social workers can focus on families. Lore said she agrees with front-line workers who say they need more services to support families, adding that the ministry needs a “fundamental rethink” of its services. “Because while recruiting, and retaining and supporting staff is and has to stay a priority, so is making sure that they as social workers, as front-line staff, have access to the services and supports that families need,” she said. When asked about the decision to abandon the government’s workload analysis tool in 2021, Lore said the ministry is developing a “workforce strategy.” She said it is important to think about not just the number of vacancies, but “how those roles exist.” “What is really important is the changing complexity of this work. That we know the depth and breadth of needs of families has changed over recent years. We know that what they need from us has changed and so that workforce strategy is about identifying and meeting that need,” she said. The report credits the ministry with taking action to improve working conditions and compliance with the requirement for in-person visits following the boy’s death, but says more work must be done to support current staff and recruit and retain more social workers. The office says the staffing issues are not confined to just rural and remote communities. “Currently it’s in every area of the province. It’s the Okanagan, it’s Victoria, it’s the Lower Mainland. There were  offices in  of 2022 that were staffed at  per cent or less, and they were throughout the province in urban and rural areas. Of course it’s more acute in rural areas ” Markwart said. The BC General Employees’ Union said in a statement that the concerns in the report are not new, but require “urgent attention” “Both our union and (the representative) have been sounding the alarm for many years about the impact of heavy workloads, challenges with staff recruitment and retention, the increasing complexity of child protection work, and chronic social worker staffing shortages on our province’s child welfare system,” the statement says. Charlesworth said she meets frequently with government officials, including Lore, and while her findings “may sting a little,” they won’t be a surprise. She said she’s hopeful the government will follow through on her recommendation, adding there are a number of things already being worked on to address the issues she has raised. “Social workers in this province have incredibly difficult jobs and to see how understaffed and overworked they are is truly disturbing,” Charlesworth said in a statement accompanying her report. “We have known about chronic understaffing at this ministry for decades, yet successive governments have not addressed these challenges. Now, here we are yet again, reeling from the death of a child that was entirely preventable.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published . Ashley Joannou, The Canadian Press ",5268,867,".

54," . OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s decision to hand-pick a candidate for a riding in an upcoming Montreal byelection isn’t being well-received by three aspiring contenders who spent months campaigning only to be shunted aside. The Liberals announced Montreal city Coun. Laura Palestini last Friday as the party’s candidate in a byelection whose date has yet to be announced for the riding of LaSalle—Émard—Verdun. The byelection must be called by  . Three aspiring candidates — local school commissioner Lori Morrison; entrepreneur Christopher Baenninger; and former Quebec Liberal party organizer Eddy Kara — denounced the decision, with Morrison calling it “anti-democratic, 100 per cent.” Morrison said she couldn’t believe the party let her knock on doors and sign up memberships only to ultimately abandon plans for a nomination meeting. The nomination to become candidate in LaSalle—Émard—Verdun, Morrison said, was hotly contested because the riding “has been a Liberal stronghold for a very, very long time.” Liberal campaign co-chair Soraya Martinez Ferrada has said it was Trudeau’s decision to prevent party members from choosing the candidate and to instead select Palestini, who represents the LaSalle borough on Montreal city council. Ferrada was on vacation and unavailable for comment Monday, her office said. The party declined to make anyone else available and instead provided a statement. The Liberals have won the riding in all three elections since it was created, with former justice minister David Lametti re-elected with . per cent of the vote in 2021. The Bloc Québécois candidate received almost half as many votes — . per cent — while the New Democratic Party and the Conservatives picked up . per cent and . per cent of the vote, respectively. Lametti resigned on . , after he was excluded from Trudeau’s cabinet in last summer’s reshuffle. Baenninger said he was “in shock” at Trudeau’s decision to forgo the nomination process and hand-pick a candidate, saying it was “not right” and “demotivating.” Morrison refused to say whether the party is respecting its values by disregarding a nomination vote; Baenninger, meanwhile, said the decision falls within the rules. The party’s vetting committee, he explained, can reject any candidates in the best interest of the party. However, Baenninger said, the party didn’t do itself any favours by pushing three candidates aside in favour of Palestini. “I’m going to be shrewd: we didn’t improve our chances. I’ll leave it at that.” Trudeau’s leadership has been under scrutiny since the party failed to retain the riding of Toronto—St. Paul’s, a longtime Liberal bastion for more than three decades, that was won by the Conservatives on  . Nationally, the Liberals have been polling roughly  points behind the Tories led by Pierre Poilievre for more than one year. Both Baenninger and Morrison said that before Palestini was announced by the party, they had never heard her name before. Kara, a filmmaker and former provincial Liberal organizer, had the support of former Quebec finance minister Carlos Leitão and ex-MP Jean-Claude Poissant. He said it’s “really shocking” that Trudeau interrupted the nomination process, adding that the party sent signals that members would choose the candidate, including by publishing a nomination kit. He said he learned that the Liberals wanted someone of Italian origin to “ensure we get the Italian vote.” Kara said three members of the Liberal Party executive confirmed to him that they were also considering appointing Daniela Romano, another municipal councillor in LaSalle. According to 2016 census data, . per cent of the riding’s residents are of Italian origin. Palestini will face another municipal councillor in the byelection, as the NDP have named Craig Sauvé, who represents the nearby Sud-Ouest borough on city council.

55," . While Canada may be challenged to match its -medal haul from Tokyo at the Paris Olympics, the country does boast a potential star of the Games. Swimming sensation Summer McIntosh, , has only gotten better — much better — since finishing fourth as a -year-old in the women’s 400-metre freestyle at the 2021 Games. The Toronto native will swim in four individual events, and as many as three relays — and expectations are high. “Summer McIntosh is the single best overall swimmer in the world today. There really isn’t anybody better,” NBC swimming analyst Rowdy Gaines told his network recently. “A lot of people will know that name by the end of summer.” McIntosh holds the world record in the 400-m individual medley and is very capable of hitting the podium in the 200-m. IM, 200-m. butterfly, and 400-m. freestyle. Gaines compared McIntosh to two of the all-time American greats in an interview with CBC . “You have your Michael Phelps. You have your Summer,” he said of McIntosh, who named one of her cats ‘Mikey’ as a tribute to Phelps. “I think Summer hasn’t scratched the surface of what she’s capable of doing in Paris. I think her coaches know very well that she wasn’t going to have a problem qualifying at trials. They did with Summer what Katie (Ledecky) is kind of doing here.” McIntosh will be looking to make early waves in a big showdown on Day  of full competition when she battles the legendary Ledecky and reigning world champ Ariarne Titmus of Australia in the 400-m. freestyle on  . McIntosh finished fourth in the event at last year’s worlds before rebounding to win four overall medals. If McIntosh can come away with a similar or better haul in Paris, it will go a long way toward Canada staying at  medals or more for the third Games in a row. Nielsen’s Gracenote, in its most recent projections, tabbed Canada for  medals. Canada’s -medal total in Tokyo was its highest ever after taking home  four years earlier in Rio de Janeiro. Canada has its highest hopes in two of the marquee individual sports of the Games — swimming and track and field. Here’s a look at Canadians to keep an eye on in Paris: Artistic swimming Jacqueline Simoneau (Duet, team, Saint-Laurent, Que) After retiring following the Tokyo Games, Simoneau made the decision to return in the run-up to Paris. Simoneau and Audrey Lamothe won a pair of duet silvers at a World Cup event in Markham, Ont. in . Basketball Men’s team Canada returns to the Olympic men’s hoops competition for the first time since Steve Nash and Co. reached the quarterfinals in 2000. There’s plenty of excitement around this squad, led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, but Canada is in a very tough group. Women’s team Following an early exit at the 2021 Olympics, Spanish coach Victor Lapena took the reins. Results have been mixed. Canada had its best-ever finish at the last World Cup, taking fourth, but then barely qualified for this year’s Olympics. × women’s team Paige Crozon, Kacie Bosch, and twin sisters Michelle and Katherine Plouffe earned the last Paris spot at an Olympic qualifier in  with a win over host Hungary in the third-place game. Bosch and the Plouffes are the top three ranked players in the world, so this squad is a medal contender. Beach volleyball Brandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes (Toronto) After splitting from their previous partners in 2022, the former York University indoor teammates have reached third in the world rankings. Boxing Tammara Thibeault (Women’s  kg, Saint-Georges, Que.) Thibeault won gold at the 2022 world championship and was a quarterfinalist at the Tokyo Olympics. Canada hasn’t won an Olympic boxing medal since 1996. Breaking Philip Kim (Vancouver) Kim won silver at last year’s world championship and gold in 2022. The dance sport, making its Olympic debut in Paris, is not on the Los Angeles Games program in 2028. Canoe, sprint Katie Vincent and Sloan MacKenzie (Women’s C-, 500 metres, Mississauga, Ont. and Halifax) Vincent teamed up with the retired Laurence Vincent Lapointe to win bronze at the Tokyo Olympics in a sport making its Games debut. Vincent and MacKenzie also won bronze at last year’s worlds. Golf Brooke Henderson (Smiths Falls, Ont.) Canada’s best pro golfer of all time is seventh in the 2024 LPGA standings. After a strong start to the year, she’s had only one top- finish in her past eight events. Corey Conners (Listowel, Ont.) Conners has three top- finishes in his past five events, including a sixth-place showing at the Canadian Open. Nick Taylor (Abbotsford, B.C.) Taylor made history with his drought-breaking Canadian Open win in 2023. He also won the Phoenix Open this year. Both events are known for loud galleries. Judo Catherine Beauchemin-Pinard (Women’s  kg, Montreal) Ranked second in the world in her weight class, Beauchemin-Pinard won bronze in Tokyo. She finished off the podium at this year’s worlds. Christa Deguchi (Women’s  kg, Matsumoto, Japan) The Japanese-born Deguchi started competing for her father’s birth country in 2017. Deguchi beat out fellow world medal contender Jessica Klimkait for Canada’s lone Olympic spot after finishing second at worlds this year. Deguchi, who fell short in 2021 as Klimkait took Canada’s Olympic spot and won bronze, is ranked first in the world. Rowing Women’s eights Four rowers return from Tokyo’s gold medal-winning boat. Canada also won gold at its last World Cup event in Switzerland. Soccer Women’s team The reigning Olympic champs are trying to reach the Games podium for the fourth time in a row. But the post-Christine-Sinclair-era Canadians won’t be considered one of the favourites this year after bowing out in the group stage of last year’s World Cup. Swimming Joshua Liendo (Men’s 100-m. butterfly, 100-m. freestyle, -m. freestyle, Toronto) Liendo has three medals at his past two world championships, including silver in the 100-m. butterfly last year. Maggie Mac Neil (Women’s 100-m. butterfly, London, Ont.) Mac Neil won gold in this event at the Tokyo Olympics. She captured silver at last year’s worlds. Kylie Masse (Women’s 100-m. backstroke, 200-m. backstroke, La Salle, Ont.) The four-time Olympic medal winner finished just off the podium at last year’s worlds.

Dabrowski teamed up with New Zealand’s Erin Routliffe to reach the Wimbledon doubles final this month. Routliffe was born in Canada but represents New Zealand, so Dabrowski will join forces with Fernandez in France. Dabrowski is ranked third in the world in doubles. Track and field Marco Arop (Men’s 800 metres, Edmonton) The reigning world champ finished a surprising sixth at a recent Diamond League meet in Monaco, but he remains one of Canada’s top gold contenders. Arop is looking for his first Olympic podium after being eliminated in the semifinals in Tokyo. Andre De Grasse (Men’s 100 and 200 metres, Markham, Ont.) A three-medal winner at each of the past two Olympics (counting relays), De Grasse won’t be a favourite this time around based on his times in 2024. But it would be unwise to count a big-game performer out. Evan Dunfee (Men’s -km race walk, Richmond, B.C.) Dunfee won bronze in the -km race walk in Tokyo, but that event is no longer on the program. He was fourth in the -km event at the world championships last year. Ethan Katzberg (Men’s hammer throw, Nanaimo, B.C.) The reigning world champ has won  consecutive events dating back to  2023.

Roughly the same amount believe he would negatively impact Canada’s economy, global stability, and climate change. Only  per cent of those surveyed think it would be good or excellent to have Trump back in the White House. “While those who would support Canada’s Conservative Party in the next federal election are relatively divided about this question, the rest of the country is nearly unanimous in viewing a Trump win as bad for Canada,” the poll states.

Canadians say that another four-year Trump term will make “no difference” to the likelihood of them voting Conservative ( per cent), Liberal ( per cent) or NDP ( per cent). “Among those who are not fully committed to their current choice, a Trump re-election most likely affirms it, though there are two in five ( per cent) ‘soft’ committed NDP voters who say they would be more likely to vote for Prime Minister Trudeau and the Liberal party,” the poll states.

Biden endorsed current Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him on the Democratic ticket, but she won’t formally do so until nominated by the party’s convention delegates.

57," . Here is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to bring you up to speed… Evacuation ordered for Jasper Park and townsite Multiple wildfires in Jasper National Park flared up with a vengeance late Monday night, forcing all park visitors along with the ,700 residents of the Jasper townsite to flee west with little notice over mountain roads through darkness, soot and ash. Photos and video shared on social media illuminate a midnight cavalcade of bumper-to-bumper cars and trucks, headlights on, red tail lights glowing, cars inching, stopping, starting, crawling through swirling tendrils of acrid smoke. The Jasper townsite — and the park’s main east-west artery Highway  — were caught in a fiery pincer. Fires threatening from the northeast cut off highway access east to Edmonton. Another fire roaring up from the south forced the closure of the north-south Icefields Parkway. That left one route open — west to B.C. Park and town officials scrambled to clear up traffic gridlock, find fuel for vehicles, help vulnerable people get to safety while also marshalling resources to battle the fires. Here’s what else we’re watching… Storms on the way as B.C. wildfires ramp up The B.C. Wildfire Service says a significant change in the weather could ramp-up fire activity, as Environment Canada warns of severe thunderstorms in several parts of the province following weeks of hot and dry conditions. The service says there were thousands of lightning strikes over the weekend in the province’s north, and more lightning is on the way for multiple regions, with severe storms potentially bringing gusty winds, hailstones the size of nickels and heavy downpours of rain. The service says hot and dry conditions persist in the south of the province, with more than 350 fires burning across B.C., four of which are categorized as “wildfires of note.” Environment Canada says heat warnings remain in effect for a number of communities, where daytime temperatures have hovered above  degrees, although temperatures are expected to ease over the coming days. The B.C. Ministry of Transportation says non-essential travel to the Interior is also discouraged as wildfire activity has increased, warning of potential highway closures and delays. LCBO stores to reopen across Ontario Hundreds of Ontario’s liquor stores will reopen today following a strike that saw their doors close in early . About ,000 Liquor Control Board of Ontario workers returned Monday to prepare for the opening of nearly 700 stores after they walked off the job on  . In addition to reopened retail stores, the LCBO says there will also no longer be limits on online orders, but any online order may take up to three weeks for delivery. Smaller bars and restaurants began to see dwindled alcohol supplies as the strike stretched on for two weeks. The Ontario Public Service Employees Union, which represents LCBO workers, had said the labour dispute was largely about Premier Doug Ford’s plan to allow convenience and grocery stores to sell ready-to-drink cocktails, saying expanded sales of the beverages would threaten their jobs. What will make Toronto resilient to flood? Toronto city councillors, who presided last week over a city of inundated transit stations, roadways and basements, are set to discuss how to make the metropolis more resilient to climate-fuelled floods. Mayor Olivia Chow’s motion, to be tabled at Wednesday’s city council meeting, is expected to stir discussion on flood mitigation efforts. The motion, recognizing how climate change has made flood-inducing storms more intense and frequent, asks city staff to look at what discontinued programs could be resuscitated, which ones are already working, and what more can be done. Experts say Toronto, and most other major cities in Canada, face a tall task. Across Canada, a once-in-every--years rainstorm could come around every  years by late century if planet-warming fossil fuels continue to be burned at high levels, according to a 2019 federal assessment. In Toronto, extreme rainstorms could carry  per cent more rainfall by 2080, a recent city report indicated. Accused to testify in Coutts conspiracy trial The trial of two men charged with conspiring to murder Mounties at the Coutts border blockade in Alberta is expected to hear more testimony today from one of the accused. Chris Carbert has told court he brought guns and body armour to the blockade, but says there was no plan for violence unless he had to perhaps flee to the mountains and fend off someone trying to give him a COVID- vaccine shot. Carbert and Anthony Olienick are being tried together in front of a jury in Court of King’s Bench in Lethbridge.

58," . BARKERVILLE, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA — The British Columbia gold rush town of Barkerville is drenched, both from overnight rains and sprinklers dousing its timber buildings, some more than 150 years old. It’s part of an effort to save the historic park that is one of the Cariboo region’s premier tourist attractions from the flames of the Antler Creek wildfire that is burning out of control about three kilometres away, said Stewart Cawood, Barkerville’s public programming and media manager. “Today is looking better with the rain that we had overnight, but with it being so close and fires being so unpredictable, even with all these protective measures in place, there’s absolutely a concern we could lose the town,” he said. The storms that have drenched the region are a mixed blessing, soaking the town but also bringing lightning that the BC Wildfire Service fears could cause another burst of wildfire activity in the north and parts of the south after weeks of hot and dry weather. Lightning is the cause of the vast majority of active fires burning across B.C. and a bulletin from the service says the province saw more than ,000 strikes on Monday. The province’s active fire tally surged past 400 on Tuesday, including more than 100 new fires detected in the past  hours. In the Thompson-Nicola region, there was confirmation that the nearly 200-square-kilometre Shetland Creek fire had destroyed more than  structures in the Venables Valley, where it is burning out of control. Colton Davies, the district emergency operations centre information officer, said that included six primary residences, and emergency officials had met late Monday with people whose homes may have been lost. The Shetland and Antler Creek fires are among the four so-called “wildfires of note” in B.C., meaning they pose a threat to life or property or are highly visible. The -square-kilometre Antler Creek fire triggered an evacuation order for Barkerville, Bowron Lake Provincial Park and for the community of Wells, B.C., on Sunday. Cawood said all visitors, non-essential staff and animals — including a cat, horses, goats and chickens — were evacuated from Barkerville before the order was made on Sunday. He said only BC wildfire crews and specially trained staff remained at the town, which was established in 1862 when prospector William Barker struck gold. The town’s website says it features more than 125 heritage buildings, and it was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1924. Barkerville was destroyed by a fire in 1868 before being rebuilt. Its protectors are doing what they can to avoid a repeat, saying on the town’s Facebook page that “every drop helps” in the attempt to keep the town wet and safe. “The sprinkler systems are running throughout the town, so the town is damp at the moment,” Cawood said. In a post to social media on Monday, the wildfire service said heavy smoke in the region helped to “lessen wildfire behaviour” as groundcrews with heavy equipment established control lines, which are barriers used to contain or control a blaze. But, it noted, the fire may still increase in size and smaller fires may merge with the blaze. It also said structure protection specialists have deployed systems that are used to create a “humidity bubble” to the site and the surrounding areas. The technique, which includes adding sprinklers to the roofs of buildings, aims to “increase the relative humidity and minimize how embers impact structures ahead of wildfires.” The number of wildfires in B.C. has soared from less than 100 two weeks ago, with the Shetland Creek fire in the Thompson-Nicola region, and the Aylwin Creek blaze in Central Kootenay also triggering evacuation orders and alerts. Silverton, B.C., Mayor Tanya Gordon said the weather had cleared smoke near the Central Kootenay village, but it has added to residents’ anxiety because people can now easily see Aylwin and Komondo Creek fires burning just south of the community. Gordon said the village has not received any updates from the wildfire service on the status of the fires and residents are “anxious” as Highway  southbound out of town has been closed. “The smoke has lifted, and it’s becoming more real,” Gordon said of the fire situation. “Something like this hasn’t happened (in Silverton) for a long time.” She said residents were also nervous about a number of fires further north on Highway , the only major route out of the community. “When this is over, we definitely need to sit down to think about evacuation routes (in the future),” Gordon says. The Transport Ministry is discouraging non-essential travel to and within wildfire areas, to reduce road congestion associated with evacuations. Nearby fires have forced the closures of Highway  near Wells and Barkerville, and Highway  south of Silverton. The wildfire service said it had recommended the reopening of a section of Highway  north of Spences Bridge that had been closed due to the Shetland Creek fire. Motorists are also warned to stay off routes from Jasper National Park in Alberta, as thousands of Albertan fire evacuees are forced to drive through B.C. to get to reception centres in Calgary and Grande Prairie. Those evacuees are being directed back to their own province because B.C. has “no capacity to house Albertans,” according to Alberta Emergency Management Agency managing director Stephen Lacroix. B.C. has been dealing with an influx of travellers from Jasper since Monday night, when a fire forced park visitors and ,700 residents of the town to flee west with little notice. Photos and video on social media show a midnight cavalcade of bumper-to-bumper vehicles making slow progress through swirling smoke. B.C. Minister of Emergency Management Bowinn Ma said in a social media post that the province would do everything it could to provide safe refuge for evacuees. The ministry said around midday Tuesday that about 470 properties are on evacuation order in B.C., and another ,100 were on alert, but called the situation “dynamic and everchanging.” An evacuation alert is meanwhile in effect for properties on the west side of Williams Lake, where crews stopped a fast-moving fire from advancing further into the central Interior community after it destroyed structures in an industrial area. The River Valley fire is now classified as “being held.” Environment Canada has issued rainfall warnings for parts of northwestern B.C., while the wildfire service says downpours may be accompanied by hail and erratic winds with the potential to fan fires and affect aerial firefighting and access to dirt roads. Heat warnings that covered parts of the province for weeks have been lifted, replaced with special air quality statements due to wildfire smoke spanning the length of B.C.’s boundary with Alberta. — By Brieanna Charlebois and Chuck Chiang in Vancouver This report by The Canadian Press was first published .

Thousands of wildfire evacuees forced from Jasper National Park into British Columbia along smoke-choked mountain roads Monday night were directed Tuesday to make a wide U-turn and head home if they needed a place to stay. Alberta fire officials said B.C. has its hands full with its own wildfires and evacuations . “The issue is the severity of wildfire activity and evacuations in B.C. proper,” Stephen Lacroix, managing director of the Alberta Emergency Management Agency, told reporters during a video conference. “They had no capacity to house Albertans.” Alberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis said reception centres were being set up in Grande Prairie to the north and Calgary to the south. Ellis told evacuees to take massive detours, either through Prince George, B.C., proceeding north and east to Grande Prairie, or south to Kamloops before going east to Calgary. “One fire is approximately  kilometres south of Jasper on both sides of the (Athabasca) River and wind may exacerbate the situation,” Ellis told reporters. “It’s a challenging time for all impacted.” #wildfires just 5cliks south of #Jasper everyone on highway16 and 93A evacuated. #alberta #Jasper pic.twitter.com/KbRw0y71o5 — Chinar Desai (@CSD_Chinar)  Everyone in Jasper National Park — tourists, hikers, campers, boaters — along with ,700 residents of the Jasper townsite were ordered out late Monday night as wildfires pinched off escape routes to the east and south. The result was a long, slow-moving line of cars and trucks heading west through the mountains to B.C. in darkness, swirling smoke, soot and ash. Many evacuees sought refuge for the night in Valemount, B.C., a town of ,000 about 120 kilometres west of Jasper. “The community’s pretty full,” said town administrator Anne Yanciw in an interview Tuesday morning. “Every parking lot, boulevard, side of the road, field … anything that looks like it could fit a vehicle is full.” Some evacuees spent the night on the floor of the local arena. Others bunked down at the Legion. A local church was serving a pancake breakfast while drinks, snacks, information and a respite were on offer at Valemount’s community hall and visitors’ centre. “It’s all hands on deck,” Yanciw said. She said most travellers were beginning to make their way down the smoky road — slowly, but without incident. “The hope is that most of them will find the long way back to Alberta,” Yanciw said. Fire officials said forecast windy conditions were expected to make Tuesday a challenging day for crews. The province has been baking and sweltering for days in  C-plus temperatures.

64," . QUEBEC CITY, Que. — Cardinal Gérald Lacroix announced on Monday he is resuming his duties as archbishop of Quebec City, after a Vatican-mandated investigation released in  found no evidence tying the senior church leader to sexual misconduct allegations. Lacroix, , had taken a six-month absence beginning in late  when the abuse allegations first surfaced as part of a class-action lawsuit against the Quebec City diocese for alleged historical sexual abuse cases. In response to those claims, Pope Francis mandated retired Quebec judge André Denis to investigate. And while the alleged victim did not participate in the probe, Denis announced in  that his investigation didn’t exonerate Lacroix but failed to uncover any evidence that would justify a canonical trial. In the weeks since Denis’s report, Lacroix and others accused in the class action have requested intervener status, which will allow them to make submissions before the court. A ruling is pending in the request. On Monday in a news release, the archbishop — who is a member of the Pope’s Council of Cardinals — described the past months as a “difficult journey.” “But the conclusions of Judge Denis’ investigation, the support of those around me and the possibility of making myself heard that could result from the request for intervention (in the lawsuit) lead me to calmly resume my ministry,” Lacroix said. “The community knows to what extent the (Catholic) church in Quebec City condemns reprehensible acts and knows the measures we have taken to prevent them.” Lacroix’s name was among  added to a list in  of perpetrators in a class-action lawsuit, authorized by the Superior Court in 2022, alleging sexual abuse by clergy and staff dating back to 1940. The alleged sexual touching involving Lacroix took place between 1987 and 1988 in Quebec City when the unnamed female plaintiff was . In , lawyer Alain Arsenault says the alleged victim, now in her 50s, had been reluctant to come forward because of the impact her allegations would have had on her devout parents. Lacroix has denied the allegations, which he has described as “unfounded,” and the claims against him have not been tested in court. Back in , the Vatican said Denis’s report did not “permit to identify any actions that amount to misconduct or abuse,” adding, “no further canonical procedure” is expected. Denis, a retired Quebec Superior Court justice, told reporters in  that his investigation was incomplete because of the complainant’s refusal to take part. But he said that despite the interviews he conducted and his extensive search through church archives, he couldn’t find anything to substantiate the allegations. Denis described the cardinal’s record as “impeccable.” A lawyer representing the alleged victim said in  his client preferred to testify in court and did not wish to take part in the Vatican-mandated investigation because it was an internal church process that lacked credibility. The allegations against Lacroix are part of the same lawsuit that alleged sexual misconduct by Quebec Cardinal Marc Ouellet between 2008 and 2010. Ouellet, , has denied the allegations and countersued the woman who made them for defamation. He was later hit with another allegation of sexual misconduct in 2020, which he has also denied. Ouellet retired last  from a posting at the Vatican where he oversaw the powerful Bishops’ Office.

65," . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control has rolled over on plans to require dog owners crossing the border from Canada to fill out onerous paperwork this summer, the agency announced Monday. The CDC had laid out new rules in  that were aimed at keeping dog-variant rabies out of the country. The rules stated dogs must to be microchipped, vaccinated against rabies and accompanied by two forms, including one signed by a veterinarian. The forms were supposed to include photos of the dog’s teeth and would be verified upon arrival by border agents. The changes, which were set to take effect beginning . , had been panned by veterinary associations, the tourism industry and the federal government in Canada. Officials said they were trying to secure an exemption because of Canada’s status as a rabies-free country. Last week, Health Minister Mark Holland said he had secured a partial exemption to the rules and was hopeful for a grace period. The CDC announcement on Monday goes further. “These updates incorporate the feedback received from the public, industry partners, and various countries on the dog importation rule, and clarify and simplify the processes for those bringing dogs from dog rabies-free or low-risk countries,” the CDC said in a statement on Monday. As long as the dog has been in a low-risk or rabies-free country for the last six months, it can cross the border with just an import form that can be completed online the day of travel. The change has eased concerns for some advocates who were pushing for an exemption for service dogs, but Michelle Barlak said there’s still more work to be done. Barlak is a public relations specialist with The Seeing Eye, a New Jersey-based non-profit that breeds and trains guide dogs and helps train guide dog handlers, including handlers from Canada. The Seeing Eye was among a group of advocacy organizations in the U.S. that has been hounding the CDC to make an exemption for service dogs and their handlers. “Unfortunately, the CDC dog import form, which is still required in all cases, is inaccessible to those using screen readers to access the page,” she said in an email on Monday. The original CDC form was also not accessible to people using screen readers. Barlak also noted that handlers from high-risk rabies countries will still have to meet the original requirements on . . The CDC’s list of countries that are considered high risk for rabies includes a number of popular vacation destinations such as Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Thailand and Vietnam. Without an exemption, any service dog handler who has travelled to one of those countries in the previous six months would have to jump through the CDC’s hoops with longer forms and sign-off from a vet before heading to the United States, even if they live in Canada or another rabies-free country. In an interview Thursday before the changes were announced, the Seeing Eye’s Melissa Allman expressed frustration that the CDC has not been responsive to concerns about how the changes would affect service dog handlers. “I think that it is an erosion of our rights that we’ve worked very hard to create and uphold and protect since our founding in 1929,” said Allman, who is a guide dog handler and the organization’s advocacy and government relations specialist. “Here I am in a position where I’m supposed to advocate for the rights of people and I feel like I have to tell people, ‘Sorry, things are not as good as they were.'” ",3463,587," The CDC had laid out new rules in  that were aimed at keeping dog-variant rabies out of the country .

66," . Observers expect Kamala Harris to follow President Joe Biden’s roadmap for America’s relationship with Canada as she moves to secure the Democratic party’s presidential nomination. “On the key things that matter for Canada-U.S. relations, her outlook is very similar to the president,” said Christopher Sands, director of the Canada Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. Biden endorsed Harris, his second-in-command, as he dropped out of the 2024 presidential race Sunday. Biden bowed to weeks of pressure after appearing confused and frail during a debate with Republican rival Donald Trump last month, followed by missteps on the world stage during the NATO leaders’ conference. The vice-president moved quickly to shore up support for her bid to be the party’s presidential nominee. Harris has received the blessing of important Democratic figures including former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who holds significant influence and sway within the party. “The most important thing is the remarkable degree to which the party has coalesced around Harris,” said the University of Pennsylvania’s Marc Trussler. Trussler, director of data science for the university’s program on opinion research and election studies, said the main risk of Biden’s departure was whether the Democrats could present a united front in his wake. Harris looks to be able to sweep the support of delegates ahead of the party’s national convention next month, where a choice of presidential candidate will be confirmed. Trussler, who is Canadian, said Biden’s departure and the party’s response was a critical moment for the Democrats to decide what the election was going to be about: Biden’s mental acuity or Trump’s policies. “It seems more likely than not this election will now be about Donald Trump,” Trussler said. Kirsten Hillman, Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., said the relationship between the two countries flourished under the leadership of Biden, who she described as “an experienced, thoughtful and dedicated leader.” Even so, Canadians have been reaching out to Democrats and Republicans alike for months to make their case for co-operation ahead of the  election. Top of mind is the looming review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement in 2026. Harris was one of  U.S. senators to vote against the trade agreement, saying it didn’t do enough to protect American workers or the environment. During his presidency, Trump pushed for renegotiation of the old North American Free Trade Agreement and his administration introduced billions of dollars’ worth of tariffs, particularly on Chinese imports. He has threatened more tariffs and decreased aid to Ukraine, fighting off Russia’s invasion, if he wins a second term in office. “Under our leadership, the United States will be respected again,” Trump said last week during a lengthy speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Softwood lumber and Canada’s digital services tax are key areas of contention for both Republicans and Democrats. Biden’s tenure brought some stability but not much change. He largely kept Trump’s tariffs in place, despite promises to reverse them. There has also been tension over the Biden administration’s Buy American procurement rules. Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said he wasn’t concerned by some signaling that Democrats could continue leaning toward protectionist policies under Harris. Singh, speaking from Timmons, Ont., told reporters that Trump was a bully but Biden was more open to compromise on important aspects of trade. Melissa Haussman, professor emeritus at Carleton University in Ottawa, said she believes Harris “gets it” on trade, especially with Canada. Garry Keller, vice-president of the lobby firm Strategy Corp., said he expects those protectionist policies to continue under the Harris banner. The Democrats will have to work hard to win the blue-wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, said Keller, who was chief of staff to former Conservative foreign minister John Baird. In 2016, they swung Republican when Trump went on to win, and in 2020 they went Democrat and helped put Biden in the White House. Canadians should focus less on how this specific election turns out, said Alasdair Roberts, a professor of public policy at University of Massachusetts Amherst. Instead, Roberts said, Canadian governments need to build long-term strategies to deal with an increasingly tumultuous American political system “The long-term reality for Canada, regardless of who wins this election, is that the United States is going through a period of political and social instability that’s going to last for several years,” said Roberts, a Canadian. The powers of the president and the role of the federal government have expanded since the Second World War and it’s now a “winner-takes-all competition,” Roberts said. It has led to an increasingly volatile electoral environment and makes America an increasingly difficult neighbour. The challenge for Canadians, Roberts said, is “figuring out how to manage that instability.” That means “intensified, distributed diplomacy” which doesn’t just focus on Washington, he said. It must also include conversations with state governments, critical industries and American citizens themselves. Roberts suspects leaders in Ottawa and across Canada are already coming up with plans for worst-case scenarios for the relationship with Canada’s largest partner. He said they are likely asking “what you can do to reduce dependence on the United States.” ",5526,848,". Observers expect Kamala Harris to follow President Joe Biden’s roadmap for America’s relationship with Canada as she moves to secure the Democratic party’s presidential nomination. “On the key things that matter for Canada-U.S. relations, her outlook is very similar to the president,” said Christopher Sands, director of the Canada Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. Biden endorsed Harris, his second-in-command, as he dropped out of the 2024 presidential race Sunday. Biden bowed to weeks of pressure after appearing confused and frail during a debate with Republican rival Donald Trump last month, followed by missteps on the world stage during the NATO leaders’ conference. The vice-president moved quickly to shore up support for her bid to be the party’s presidential nominee.

67," . RICHMOND, B.C. — A crash of an Air Nootka De Havilland plane on Vancouver Island last year has reopened a debate between the Transportation Safety Board and the federal government over stall warning systems. The pilot who was the only person on board was seriously injured when his plane stalled and crashed into thick forest while attempting to land near Gold River, B.C. A Transportation Safety Board report says there are a few aircraft types still in commercial operation that don’t have stall warning systems, including the De Havilland DHC-. The Air Nootka plane didn’t have a warning system, and the report says that since 1998 it has investigated  De Havilland’s stalling and crashing, resulting in at least  deaths. It says it recommended to Transport Canada in 2017 that all of the commercially operated planes be equipped with stall warning systems, but the government said it would not make that requirement. The safety board says it doesn’t agree with Transport Canada’s conclusion that even with the warning system installed, when a stall occurs the pilot has little to no time to react and recover. The safety board’s report says a warning system is one of the last lines of defence against accidental stall. “To reduce the risk of losing control of an aircraft, the pilot must have an immediate, clear indication of an impending stall,” the report says. It says that until Transport Canada brings in new measures to address the risks of stall-related accidents, the board believes the risks from the safety deficiency remain. The safety message in the report says planes originally certified without stall warning systems can benefit from aftermarket systems. “Stall warning systems can reduce the risks pilots face when flying manoeuvres at higher angles of attack, such as arrivals and departures,” the report concludes.

After a successful teaching career in Nova Scotia, John Savage who is now retired, moved to Japan with his wife. “I’ve been living overseas for over  years,” he said. One thing Savage did not change in the move was his Canadian bank. “I have been with RBC bank since the early 1980s and have had no issues until recently.” For years, Savage has been able to transfer money from his RBC account, which contains his life savings and retirement funds, to his bank in Japan. He said that all changed back in . “In Japan, any Canadian that lives here, is having trouble accessing our funds through an international transfer.” The problem is the RBC app — which is used to send transfers and verify customer’s identity — is not yet available to download in Japan. Savage was told he could use the website to transfer his money, but ran into problems doing that as well. “For that, they require you to have a North American phone number in order for them to verify your identity,” he said. “I’ve been overseas for over  years. I don’t have a North American phone number and never will.” A Canadian man who lives aboard says he is not able to access his money from his Canadian bank. (CityNews) Savage reached out multiple times to RBC customer service but still has no way of getting a hold of money he needs while in Japan. “We depend on those funds for our living expenses. RBC said they’re working on it but you never get any concrete information on timelines or how close it is. So it’s been quite frustrating.” He contacted Speakers Corner and we reached out to an RBC spokesperson to weigh in. They could not comment on his case, citing privacy issues, but said a representative would be in contact to help him. “Protecting our clients’ financial information is among our highest priorities and -step verification provides an extra layer of security to our online and mobile banking experience,” the spokesperson said. They went on to say while the RBC app is required to complete that verification, the app is not available to be downloaded in Japan at this time. “We continue to explore opportunities to increase international availability of our app in the future,” the spokesperson said. In their statement to Speakers Corner, RBC said customers in Japan can still use online banking to send up to $,500 per day but when we asked Savage to try doing it that way, he still had problems. “I have tried online banking numerous times and when you go to hit international transfer, it comes up that you need to have this app because they have to verify your identity,” Savage said. He’s hopeful RBC will soon make the app available in Japan. Currently, it is up and running in  countries. Savage is also waiting to hear from a bank representative to help him solve the issue. “I’m not here to slam RBC. I’m just saying they should be doing a better job. Luckily, I’m going back to Canada to visit in the fall, which means I can go to a bank and send money but I shouldn’t have to, not after being with RBC for  years.” If you have an issue, story or question you’d like us to report on, reach out here .

69," . WILLIAMS LAKE, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA — Residents of Williams Lake, B.C., got a front-row look at the wildfire fight to save their community, as water bombers swooped low and dropped red fire retardant, crews sprayed structure fires from ladders and RCMP evacuated homes. “Everybody was panicked, (which was) understandable because the fire was less than a road across from us,” resident Spencer Stratton said, noting well over 100 people had gathered about a block away as the River Valley fire reached the western edge of the central Interior city. “It was one set of buildings away from us — that’s how close the fire was.” Residents who were evacuated were told Monday they could return and the BC Wildfire Service said crews were “mopping up” from the blaze. But Rob Warnock, the director of the Williams Lake emergency operations centre, said in a video posted to the city’s website that those homes remain subject to an evacuation alert, meaning residents must be ready to leave again quickly. Warnock said the blaze was sparked when a tree fell on power lines in the river valley on the city’s west side on Sunday, while the BC Wildfire Service website said it was suspected to be human-caused. With the winds at the time, Warnock said the fire “made a big run” down the valley on Sunday. The blaze, which the wildfire service said had grown to  hectares in size, destroyed some structures in an industrial area and prompted evacuations as the city declared a local state of emergency. Videos and photos shared on social media showed residents watching firefighting planes as black smoke billowed from behind businesses on MacKenzie Avenue where the fire had spread behind a school bus depot. Stratton said the buses were unscathed. WL Forestry Supplies said in a Facebook post that the MacKenzie Avenue store had been saved thanks to the efforts of fire crews. “We got lucky. Lost some equipment out back, but nothing serious,” the post said. The fire is one of more than 340 blazes burning in B.C., with clusters along B.C.’s boundary with Alberta as well as in the central Interior. Fire activity has been surging across B.C. The Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness said there are about 440 properties on evacuation order and ,000 under alert, calling the situation “dynamic and everchanging.” Cariboo-Chilcotin legislator Lorne Doerkson said in social media posts that there had been “explosions” during the firefight Sunday on the outskirts of Williams Lake, and the efforts of the fire crews “had a massive impact.” “There are some small spot fires, but I will say that there are very many groundcrews and equipment fighting what is left of this fire,” he said in a Facebook post around midnight Sunday. Williams Lake had asked residents on Sunday to conserve as much water as possible for fire crews taking on the blaze. The wildfire service said Williams Lake was being used to supply firefighting aircraft and was closed to the public. Some of the city’s residents on Monday still had safety concerns. Stephanie Symons said she had been getting messages and calls from friends “wondering what to do and if it’s time to pack up and go.” “The fire is still very much active and flaring back up so I can’t tell you much other than we are all stressed and it’s not over,” Symons said in a message. “We just got a severe thunderstorm warning on top of all this, so we are nowhere near in the clear yet.” Environment Canada issued that warning on Monday. The BC Wildfire Service noted in its situation report Monday that the province had seen more than ,000 lightning strikes on Sunday. It had previously said fires are showing up in areas that have seen dry lightning strikes in recent days. B.C. Premier David Eby said Monday the government was bringing in all the resources it can to help people threatened by wildfires. “It’s an incredibly stressful time for a lot of British Columbians. We’ve got hundreds of people on evacuation order. We’ve got thousands on notice that they may need to evacuate their homes. And this is, unfortunately, the beginning of the fire season that we were concerned about,” Eby said during an unrelated news conference. A couple hundred kilometres northeast of Williams Lake, the Cariboo Regional District declared a local state of emergency due to the Antler Creek fire, issuing evacuation orders for the District of Wells and the historic mining tourist town of Barkerville over the weekend. The evacuation was expanded Monday to include the popular tourist destination of Bowron Lake Provincial Park. Not all of the park is under evacuation order, but most of the lakes are included along with the Mount Tisdale Ecological Reserve, an area of alpine parkland. In the southern Interior, the nearly 200-square-kilometre Shetland Creek wildfire prompted the Thompson-Nicola Regional District to expand an evacuation order along the Thompson River between Ashcroft to the north and Spences Bridge to the south. Highway  was closed for  kilometres, north of Spences Bridge. The district said about nine properties have been added to the order that now covers a total of  addresses, while residents of another 213 properties have been told to be ready to leave on short notice. The regional district has confirmed that some structures in the Venables Valley area have been lost to the fire. Other fires of note are the Aylwin Creek and nearby Komonko Creek fires in the province’s southeast. The Regional District of Central Kootenay has ordered multiple evacuation orders for both fires. The Transport Ministry said non-essential travel to and within fire-affected areas was being discouraged “to help avoid traffic congestion on evacuation routes.” The intense fire activity across B.C. has been associated with a hot spell that sent temperatures in the Interior past  C in recent days. Environment Canada has  heat alerts in place for Interior and eastern B.C., although alerts have been lifted in western regions. Smoke from the wildfires has also resulted in special air-quality statements being issued for almost the entire eastern side of B.C., from the Washington border to Fort Nelson in the province’s northeast corner. — By Brieanna Charlebois in Vancouver.

The Israeli military says the man drove to the entrance of the town of Netiv HaAsara, just 300 metres north of the Gaza border. The military says the man left his vehicle with a knife and approached the local security patrol, who opened fire and killed him. There were no other injuries, the military said, providing a photo of a kitchen knife with a black handle. The rescue service Zaka also said nobody was injured. A video with no sound shows security officials pointing guns at a vehicle, from which a man exits, runs briefly and falls to the ground. Israeli police told The Associated Press the man was Canadian, though the Israeli military would not confirm the nationality, instead saying that “the suspect is a foreign national who arrived in the area from within Israeli territory, and not from the Gaza Strip.” Israel’s ambassador to Canada posted the military statement on X.

Here is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to bring you up to speed… President Joe Biden ends his 2024 re-election bid Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined a chorus of officials and political compatriots praising Joe Biden’s years of public service on Sunday after the president bowed to weeks of mounting pressure and officially withdrew from his country’s looming election. Biden’s decision to step aside as the Democrat candidate, announced in a letter posted to social media, came after members of his own party spoke out in increasing numbers to voice concerns over the -year-old’s mental acuity and ability to win the faceoff with Republican rival Donald Trump. Trudeau said he’s known Biden for years and called the president a “true friend.” The Democrats’ calls for Biden to drop out of the race began after a disastrous debate performance against Trump and intensified following multiple missteps on the world stage during the recent NATO leaders’ summit in Washington. Concern mounted as the president made more questionable public appearances, but it remained unclear whether Biden would continue. The president told supporters Friday he was ready to get back on the road this week after recovering from COVID-, which he contracted during a critical time for his campaign. But he changed direction Sunday afternoon, first sharing his announcement online then throwing his support behind Vice-President Kamala Harris soon after. Here’s what else we’re watching… Interest rate cut possible this week: Economists Economists and market watchers are betting the Bank of Canada will deliver another interest rate cut this week amid mounting evidence that inflation is sustainably easing. Expectations that the bank will lower its overnight lending rate when it makes its scheduled announcement Wednesday have been high since last week’s release of the latest Statistics Canada inflation report, which showed annual inflation cooled to . per cent in . The inflation reading was less than the . per cent that markets had been expecting and has helped to build market confidence that the Bank of Canada may be poised for a second rate cut, on top of the -basis-point cut it announced last month. Last month’s interest rate cut, which reduced the central bank’s key rate from five to . per cent, was the first in more than four years. Royce Mendes with Desjardins says in addition to the latest inflation report, recent data showing rising unemployment as well as subdued expectations for growth by Canadian businesses all support the prospect of another cut. While inflation remains higher than the Bank of Canada’s two per cent target, Mendes said he believes delaying any longer could have negative repercussions. LCBO workers back on the job after ratifying deal Workers are back on the job today at Ontario’s main liquor retailer, but the Liquor Control Board of Ontario says stores won’t be open for business until Tuesday. The union representing ,000 of its workers announced Sunday members had ratified a new deal with the liquor retailer to end a strike that had closed its stores for two weeks. The ratification came after the deal seemed to be up in the air on Friday. Both OPSEU and the LCBO had announced a tentative agreement had been reached but the union said the strike would continue after the employer refused to sign a return-to-work protocol. The retailer said the union had introduced new monetary demands and the employer would file an unfair labour practice complaint. But the LCBO issued a statement on Saturday saying reopening plans were back underway, and a return-to-work protocol signed by both parties does not include any “new monetary items.” A look at one year of strong mayor powers In the year since so-called strong mayor powers were granted to the heads of council in a swath of Ontario municipalities, most mayors have used them sparingly — if at all — though in some corners a sense of unease with the sweeping authority remains. As of this month, nearly  mayors have had the ability for a year or more to propose bylaws and pass them with the support of one-third of councillors, veto bylaws and hire and fire department heads, among other powers. Premier Doug Ford’s government later doled out the powers to many more mayors, even when they were not interested in receiving them, and Ontario now has a total of  strong mayors. Many of them are in the province’s largest cities, and the chair of the Ontario Big City Mayors group said by and large the mayors have “exercised enormous restraint and responsibility” in exercising the powers. Year after flood took four lives, reforms are slow The mother of a boy who died a year ago in a Nova Scotia flood says her grief returns daily, along with frustration over what she considers the province’s slow pace in reforming its preparations for climate disasters. Tera Sisco’s six-year-old son Colton Sisco died after the vehicle he was in overturned during torrential thunderstorms on . About 258 millimetres of rain to the municipality of West Hants — a rural area northwest of Halifax — fell during the overnight flash flood. Natalie Harnish, six, died in the same vehicle as Sisco, while -year-old Nick Holland and -year-old Terri-Lynn Keddy were swept away from a vehicle on the same road and also died. The tragedy has drawn repeated calls for the Progressive Conservative government to improve the province’s emergency alert system, as severe weather events are hitting the province with disturbing regularity. A recent review released by the municipality of West Hants said two hours and  minutes passed between the first rescue responses and the province sending an alert urging citizens to “shelter in place.” Blair Feltmate, director of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo has called that “far too long a delay.” Elation in Newfoundland town for rescued fishers There was a powerful word being repeated in the joyful Newfoundland community of New-Wes-Valley on Sunday: “Miracle.” Over and over, residents out walking or chatting to one another in local stores described the rescue of seven fishermen from the area who had somehow survived two days in a life-raft on the Atlantic ocean as nothing short of miraculous. The Elite Navigator fishing boat and its crew seemed to vanish on Wednesday night after several days at sea fishing for turbot. The craft was reported missing on Thursday after transmitting its final signal at around : p.m. the night before, the Canadian Coast Guard said. The vessel had caught fire, forcing the crew to abandon the ship and wait for rescue on the life-raft.

73," . HALIFAX — The mother of a boy who died a year ago in a Nova Scotia flood says her grief returns daily, along with frustration over what she considers the province’s slow pace in reforming its preparations for climate disasters. Tera Sisco’s six-year-old son Colton Sisco died after the vehicle he was in overturned during torrential thunderstorms on . About 258 millimetres of rain to the municipality of West Hants — a rural area northwest of Halifax — fell during the overnight flash flood. “It’s still a struggle, every day,” said Sisco in a recent telephone interview. As the one-year mark of her son’s death approached, she said her memories of being with him before the flooding are “on replay.” “It’s hard. … there’s part of me that still doesn’t want to believe it happened.” Natalie Harnish, six, died in the same vehicle as Sisco, while -year-old Nick Holland and -year-old Terri-Lynn Keddy were swept away from a vehicle on the same road and also died. The tragedy has drawn repeated calls for the Progressive Conservative government to improve the province’s emergency alert system, as severe weather events are hitting the province with disturbing regularity. A recent review released by the municipality of West Hants said two hours and  minutes passed between the first rescue responses and the province sending an alert urging citizens to “shelter in place.” Blair Feltmate, director of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo has called that “far too long a delay.” Sisco said she was disturbed that during flooding in the Annapolis Valley on  , it again required about three hours between the first reports of rescues and an emergency alert going out. On that night, -year-old Eli Young was swept into a drainage ditch in Wolfville an hour before an alert was sent. “My heart breaks for that family and for that boy, and for the community,” said Sisco. John Lohr, the minister responsible for the Emergency Measures Organization, said in an interview Thursday municipalities had the responsibility to send alerts to provincial authorities for distribution. He has sent a letter to wardens and mayors asking they “be more vigilant in issuing alerts,” and asked them to “schedule refresher training for appropriate municipal staff as necessary.” However, Sisco said the bottom line is that government, a year later, didn’t seem to have made significant improvements to the alert system’s timeliness. “It’s a finger pointing thing currently, and I feel like ultimately all levels of government need to sit down and really focus on how we move forward to fix the problem, rather than play the blame game,” she said. Lohr said there is training available for regional emergency planners and other municipal staff who want to directly send alerts, and there are also courses provided on how to fill out the forms to send to the provincial emergency centre. The minister said the government plans to bring in legislation creating a new department responsible for overseeing regional emergency measures. He also has promised to establish a new volunteer group for emergency response referred to as the Nova Scotia Guard, and to modernize the emergency management and alert system. Lohr said the Nova Scotia Guard will permit citizens to enter themselves in a database indicating skills they can offer after emergencies — “whether handling a chainsaw or making sandwiches” — and he said the province would call upon the volunteers when needed. The opposition parties have criticized the concept, saying they fear it could potentially drain existing volunteer pools. Sisco is concerned potential firefighters, who carry out crucial rescues during emergencies, may choose to join the new volunteer group rather than take on the heavier training workload in the fire or rescue services. “There’s still a lot that has to be worked on and figured out before we really start saying whether we should implement it (the Nova Scotia Guard),” she said. “I’m not sure at this point how it is going to help.” Sisco is instead urging the minister to focus on reforming existing systems, such as ensuring that regional emergency co-ordinators are full-time positions, rather than part-time roles carried out by officials with other responsibilities. In addition, she’s lobbying for effective, on-call systems to ensure a municipal official is constantly available to either request or send an alert. Lohr said moving towards a quicker system has been complicated by consultations that indicate many volunteer fire departments are reluctant to become directly responsible for sending emergency notices. However, he said his department is working towards more firefighters and police taking on the role. “A year from now, my expectation is that we’ll have the Nova Scotia Guard … we’ll have a new department; we’ll have fire services trained with this tool,” said the minister.

75," . MONTREAL — U.S. President Joe Biden is stepping aside as the Democratic candidate in that country’s  election and throwing his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris — a Montreal-area high school graduate who spent several years in the city. Here’s what to know about her Canadian connections. Before she became America’s first female, first Black, and first South Asian vice president-elect, Harris spent several years in Montreal, where she attended Westmount High School from 1978 to 1981. She moved to the city as a teen so her mother Shyamala Gopalan, a breast-cancer researcher, could work at the Lady Davis Institute of Montreal’s Jewish General Hospital. Harris enrolled at Westmount after an initial stint at a French-language school. Dr. Michael Pollak, who worked with Gopalan in Montreal, described her in a note published on McGill University’s website as a “pioneer” who left a mark on the institution, helping to develop a method of assessing cancerous breast tissue that became standard procedure at the Jewish General and other hospitals. While Harris’s biography on the White House website doesn’t mention her time in Montreal, she later “recalled fondly” her years there in a 2021 call with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, according to a summary of the conversation known as a readout. Former classmates described Harris and her sister Maya as good students with promising futures ahead of them. “They were so extremely bright and intelligent people, they were just so smart,” former classmate Trevor Harris told The Canadian Press in 2020. In a 1981 yearbook, Harris described her favourite pastime as “dancing with Midnight Magic,” a dance troupe she founded with her friend Wanda Kagan, who remembers the two of them performing at community centres and at fundraisers. The English Montreal School Board issued a statement congratulating Harris on becoming vice president-elect in 2020 that included a photo of students holding up hand-drawn posters reading “Congratulations Kamala! Class of ’!” More recently, as vice president, Harris has had several meetings and conversations with Trudeau. In the same 2021 call in which she reminisced about her time in Montreal, Harris offered assurances that the Biden administration would “do everything it can” to secure the release of then-imprisoned Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, according to a readout. The two Canadians were released later that year. In subsequent calls and meetings, Trudeau and Harris have reportedly discussed a range of issues including women’s entrepreneurship, the COVID- pandemic, gender equality, trade, and workers rights. The two met in  in Philadelphia, where they discussed U.S.-Canada cooperation on “a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues,” including the situation in Haiti and Ukraine, the readouts state. They also “highlighted the deep-rooted partnership between Canada and the United States” and “reaffirmed their commitment to advancing shared labour priorities, including creating good-paying jobs, building opportunities for workers, and growing our economies,” the prime minister’s office said at the time. Biden on Sunday threw his support behind Harris, and described his choice to pick her as vice president as “the best decision I’ve made.” Former president Bill Clinton and former secretary and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton were also among a growing list of prominent democrats endorsing Harris for the Democratic Party nomination on Sunday, urging people to “fight with everything we’ve got to elect her.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published .

76," . Lightning-triggered wildfires over the weekend have prompted a number of evacuation orders and alerts across British Columbia, a situation that has been exacerbated by an ongoing heat wave. The BC Wildfire Service said Sunday that crews are battling more than 300 blazes, with several evacuation orders in effect in both Central and East Kootenay as well as in Thompson-Nicola, Cariboo and Bulkley — Nechako in the northwest. “Fire suppression efforts continue to be challenged due to hot, dry conditions and localized winds,” the wildfire service said in its Sunday update. “A three week heat wave continues, and more hot and dry conditions are expected to continue for most of the province.” Environment Canada said  B.C. communities broke or matched their daily high-temperature records on Saturday, with Lytton reaching a high of . degrees — breaking a record of . degrees set in 1946. Temperature records also fell in the B.C. communities of Cranbrook, Merritt, Princeton, Trail and Vernon, with all five communities reaching at least  degrees. Firefighters say the high temperatures have made conditions difficult once a fire ignites, with crews having to prioritize initial attacks on newly discovered blazes. One such fire is the Island Pond fire about  kilometres south of Canal Flats, B.C., in the East Kootenay that was discovered Saturday and grew to about  square kilometre on Sunday. The Regional District of East Kootenay has declared a state of local emergency and issued an evacuation order for two addresses as a result, and has also warned another  properties to be prepared to leave on short notice. At the Cariboo Regional District in central Interior B.C., officials have ordered residents on  parcels of land in the Kuyakuz Lake area covering 923 square kilometres to evacuate immediately, with five out-of-control wildfires burning nearby. Four of the five blazes have been confirmed to be lightning-caused. The regional district has also issued evacuation orders for the Barkerville Historic Town and Park heritage site with a cluster of out-of-control fires — including the .-square-kilometre Antler Creek blaze — burning in the area. The same blaze has triggered an evacuation order for the community of Wells, B.C., on Sunday, with the local government declaring Antler Creek as “a significant threat to the health, safety, and welfare of persons.” Barkerville public programming and media manager Stewart Cawood said an earlier evacuation alert led to the park closing on Sunday, and he is unsure when the heritage site will reopen. “It’s incredibly frustrating,” Cawood said, noting the park has been working hard to regain visitor traffic since the end of the COVID pandemic. “Unfortunately, we are at the whims and wills of Mother Nature, so there’s not much we can do. “When something like this happens, we just have to be able to roll with the punches and keep everybody safe.” Cawood said he was also concerned about the longer-term implications of wildfires’ effect on B.C.’s tourism sector on places like Barkerville. “Up until last week, we were seeing a rise of about  per cent in our numbers from last year, so we’ve been seeing a nice, steady incline since we’ve had to scale things back during the COVID years,” he said. The Cariboo Regional District said in its evacuation order that police and others will be “expediting” Barkerville’s evacuation due to “immediate danger to life safety due to fire.” The new evacuation orders and alerts come as the Shetland Creek fire about eight kilometres north of Spences Bridge, B.C., is holding at about 150 square kilometres in size. The BC Wildfire Service dashboard says about  per cent of the more than 300 blazes burning in the province have been caused by lightning. All evacuation orders and alerts linked to the Shetland Creek blaze in B.C.’s Thompson-Nicola region remain in place on Sunday for communities such as Ashcroft, Cache Creek, Spences Bridge and the Ashcroft First Nation. In the Central Kootenay, the community of Silverton, B.C., also remained on alert Sunday while 107 properties south of the village were under an evacuation order due to the nearby Aylwin Creek wildfire. Aylwin Creek and nearby Komonko Creek remained at a combined size of . square kilometres Sunday, and Highway  south of Silverton has been closed due to the two out-of-control wildfires. Evacuation orders have also been issued across Slocan Lake from Silverton, with residents and visitors at  waterfront parcels as well as a small part of Valhalla Provincial Park near Nemo Creek being told to leave immediately.

VICTORIA — The University of Victoria in British Columbia says it has told the pro-Palestinian protesters at an on-campus encampment that they are trespassing, setting the stage for the camp’s removal. The protesters say on their group social media page that the university administration has told them to “vacate by  a.m. Monday,” but add in a separate post that they are planning a rally at the camp instead.

The more who show up, the safer we will be.” The group says in a separate post that protesters “have negotiated in good faith” but described the school’s last proposed resolution as having “no concrete commitments” and containing “ineffective policy” that fails to address what they are calling a genocide in the Israel-Hamas conflict.

78," . NEW-WES-VALLEY, N.L. — There was a powerful word being repeated in the joyful Newfoundland community of New-Wes-Valley on Sunday: “Miracle.” Over and over, residents out walking or chatting to one another in local stores described the rescue of seven fishermen from the area who had somehow survived two days in a life-raft on the Atlantic ocean as nothing short of miraculous. “Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you for returning our men,” Betty Lou Pollett told a crowd of hundreds at the end of a community parade held to celebrate the fishers’ return. The Elite Navigator fishing boat and its crew seemed to vanish on Wednesday night after several days at sea fishing for turbot. The craft was reported missing on Thursday after transmitting its final signal at around : p.m. the night before, the Canadian Coast Guard said. The vessel had caught fire, forcing the crew to abandon the ship and wait for rescue on the life-raft. In New-Wes-Valley, which is an amalgamation of three small fishing communities along Newfoundland’s northeast coast, people braced for the worst. Fishing is among Canada’s deadliest professions, and tragedy is a common thread linking coastal communities across Atlantic Canada. But on Friday night, out on the ocean, searchers saw a light from a flare. It brought them to a life-raft, where the seven fishermen — who people are now calling the Lucky  — were waiting. The men spent about  hours adrift in the raft about 220 kilometres away from land, said Eugene Carter, the crew’s captain. The fire broke out on Wednesday night in a locker on the main deck when they were just a couple of hours into a -hour journey home, he said. “We tried to extinguish the fire once, and then it just shot right back at us,” Carter said in an interview. “It’s like wood burning. We heard the cracking. So we knew that it was pretty serious and that it was out of our control.” He put out three distress calls, he said, but they weren’t answered. “The fire probably melted the devices, stuff like that, wouldn’t allow it.” The crew passed the time in the life-raft telling jokes and passing their flashlight around as if it were a microphone to interview one another. It was cold and foggy and wet, and the men were crammed into a boat roughly the size of a small car. Sleep was scant, coming only if they managed to nod off with their heads tipped onto their chests. Birds — “a lot of birds” — swooped and flitted around the raft, “driving us crazy,” Carter said. As Friday wore on, a few of the fishermen seemed to be losing hope they’d ever be found. But Carter said he had a feeling. He had two flares left, and he knew he had to wait out the fog before he used either one. That night, when the sky finally cleared, he set off a smoke flare. Nothing happened for a few hours, he said, but then a helicopter appeared and flew over the raft. Carter said he scrambled to light his hand-held flare in time to wave it at the helicopter. “They didn’t see it, and that was my last flare,” he said. “But a coast guard ship was actually looking out, and seen it. And that’s what got us rescued, my last flare.” Fisher Toby Peddle said he was terrified as he leapt from the burning boat onto the life-raft. He can’t swim, he said in an interview, and he didn’t have a survival suit on. “It was either jump and risk drowning or stay and be burned,” he said. “There was no time to think about it. I just knew I had to jump.” Carter and another crew member, Jordan Lee King, promised they’d grab him as soon as he hit the water, Peddle said, and they made good on their promise. “Jordan had said, ‘Don’t worry, I’ll catch you before you even get in the water,’” recalled Peddle. He credited Carter for keeping the crew calm as they drifted in the life-raft, surrounded by nothing but fog and an endless expanse of ocean. “He just kept telling us, ‘We’re going to be fine. They know where we are, they’ll find us,’” he said. “He’s a hero.” The hardest moments came when the men could hear helicopters flying overhead and knew the pilots couldn’t see them through the fog. On Sunday, buildings around New-Wes-Valley were decorated with balloons and signs saying, “Welcome home, Lucky .” The town organized a massive vehicle parade, in which hundreds of cars drove from one end of the town to the other, decorated with streamers and giant gold balloons shaped like the number . The parade ended at the local baseball field, where hundreds gathered to hug the fishermen. They all held -shaped balloons and then released them into the sky. Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Furey gave them all an award for bravery. Mike Tiller, the mayor of New-Wes-Valley, announced the town would erect a living monument to the men and their incredible survival, and the crowd erupted. The community had previously canceled its nine-day Crab Festival when the fishers were missing out of respect for their families. Now that the men are home, the festival is back on, with opening day on Monday. Carter said he was still coming to grips with what happened. But he was ready to head back out to fish. “I told all my crew members ‘Statistically, you could be driving to Gander every day and you’d have a better chance of getting in an accident in your vehicle than of this happening again,” he said. “Don’t give up on your fishing.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published . — With files from Michael Tutton in Halifax Sarah Smellie, The Canadian Press ",5469,976,"-Valley were decorated with balloons and signs saying, “Welcome home, Lucky.” The town organized a massive vehicle parade, in which hundreds of cars drove from one end of the town to the other, decorated with streamers and giant gold balloons shaped like the number.

A government official says the Prime Minister’s Office is not disclosing the specific location for security reasons. Spokesman Mohammad Hussain says in an email that Trudeau travels on government aircraft as required, and will reimburse the equivalent of a commercial airline ticket for himself and his family. Hussain says Trudeau will also pay for his family’s stay. The PMO has consulted with the Ethics Commissioner’s office about the trip. Trudeau and his family vacationed in B.C. last summer and in Costa Rica in the summer of 2022. Trudeau was found to have violated conflict-of-interest rules in 2016 when he took a vacation to the Aga Khan’s private island in the Bahamas, and his office has said he consults the ethics commissioner ahead of personal travel plans to ensure they comply with guidelines. The Conflict of Interest Act allows politicians to accept gifts and other advantages only from relatives or family friends with whom they have a well-documented close bond. Trudeau’s family holiday in Jamaica last Christmas also generated controversy after his office revised a statement that initially said he and his family would pay for his stay. They later issued a clarification saying the prime minister and his family had stayed at no cost. Trudeau said he stayed with friends over that holiday, like most Canadians often do, and that his office followed all the necessary rules. The federal ethics commissioner, Konrad von Finkenstein, said at the time he would not investigate the trip because his office was satisfied Trudeau was hosted by a close friend.

Airports, hospitals and police services across Canada continued their gradual return to normal operations on Saturday as they recovered from a global technology outage caused by a defective update to computers using Microsoft Windows. And as systems around the world continued to come back online, one security expert warned Canadians can expect more disruptions down the road unless industry practices change. Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said Friday’s glitch felt round the world occurred when it deployed a faulty update to computers running Microsoft Windows, adding the resulting outage was not a security incident or cyberattack. Microsoft released a statement on its official blog on Saturday revealing the extent of the impact on customers. “We currently estimate that CrowdStrike’s update affected . million Windows devices, or less than one percent of all Windows machines,” wrote David Weston, a company vice-president in charge of operating system security. “While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services. In Canada, air travellers bore the brunt of that impact. Passengers with Porter Airlines saw many of their flights cancelled on Friday, and the vast majority of arrivals and departures between Canada and the U.S. at airports in Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal were postponed or called off. Related: Internet outage latest | Airlines, businesses, border crossings hit by global tech disruption Montreal’s Trudeau airport issued a statement on Saturday saying “operations have returned to normal … but flights operated by affected airlines may still be subject to schedule changes.” A spokesperson for the Vancouver International Airport told The Canadian Press the now-resolved outage continues to disrupt flights across North America, including airlines operating out of the Vancouver airport. The glitch also reared its head in the Canadian health care sector. Staff at British Columbia’s hospitals and health facilities had to pivot to paper to manage everything from lab work to meal orders during the outage. By Saturday, health-care organizations like Toronto’s University Health Network and the provincial health authority in Newfoundland and Labrador all announced regular operations had been restored. “UHN is returning to regular operation after the global IT outage. We expect no additional appointment delays,” reads a message on the University Health Network’s website. Meanwhile in Edmonton, police say 911 lines have been restored after a major disruption to emergency communications. Cybersecurity expert Steve Waterhouse says the global outage should serve as a wake-up call for Canadian organizations and companies. “It is of utmost significance because it has paralyzed so many sectors of our economy, of our society,” he said, warning there are more potential outages on the horizon stemming either from issues with another cybersecurity firm like CrowdStrike or different kinds of software. Waterhouse said the centralization of everything from data storage to email over the past few decades has led to systemic vulnerabilities when things go awry. “Organizations, public or private, have to redo their homework in properly managing the risks of not having access to the computing services that are remotely centralized,” he said, comparing a back-up plan to keeping candles in the cupboard in case the power goes out.

82," . The mayor of a British Columbia Interior community says the area’s long-term care residents have been moved out as a fast-moving wildfire looms nearby. Barbara Roden, mayor of Ashcroft, B.C., located about 360 kilometres northeast of Vancouver, said Saturday that community remains under an alert to be ready to evacuate on short notice. Roden said the anxiety among residents is “settling down a little bit” as the nearby Shetland Creek wildfire appeared to push northward Saturday. “In the early stages of a fire, there is of course a lot of stress, a lot of fear, a lot of nervousness,” she said. “(But) we’ve seen that the fire has largely stayed in a northerly course, not veering off to the east towards Ashcroft or Cache Creek, the more populated areas in this region.” Roden said crews have also helped the community’s psyche by keeping nearby Highway  open despite the Shetland Creek blaze growing to about 150 square kilometres in size. “The highway has remained open throughout, which is … I think, a big stress relief for people,” she said. “Not just because it’s an evacuation route possibly, but just because having a highway open, it’s almost a feeling of normalcy with traffic still moving up and down the highway.” Nevertheless, Roden said Interior Health has decided to relocate  long-term care residents and five in assisted-living facilities from Ashcroft in case the fire changes direction. “I think right now, we’re in a stage where it’s wait-and-see what the fire is going to do,” she said. Roden’s comments came as the Thompson-Nicola Regional District confirmed Venables Valley — just a few kilometres southwest of Ashcroft — has seen a number of structures destroyed by the Shetland Creek fire as of Saturday. The regional district’s emergency centre said officials have not been able to access the area to assess specific numbers, but preliminary estimates put the number of structures destroyed at less than . Meanwhile, the number of wildfires in British Columbia has flared up to more than 300, with more than half of those classified as out of control and about  started in the last  hours. The BC Wildfire Service said one of the primary drivers in the latest spike has been lightning; officials estimate there have been close to ,300 strikes in the province since Wednesday and  new ignitions. Firefighters in the province’s northwest said that region received “significant lightning” on Friday resulting in  new fires, although three have been extinguished. The wildfire service said the situation has been exacerbated by dryness, as recent heat waves across the province have created conditions conducive to higher fire activity. “The prolonged hot and dry conditions being experienced across the Southeast Fire Centre, paired with passing storm systems, means that residents can expect to continue to see increased overall wildfire activity across the region,” the BC Wildfire Service said in its Saturday update on social media. “With no rainfall in the southern regions the fire danger is high to extreme in most areas,” the service said in a separate update Saturday. In addition to Ashcroft, the Shetland Creek fire has so far triggered evacuation orders and alerts in Cache Creek, Spences Bridge, the Ashcroft First Nation and several Cook’s Ferry Indian Band reserves. Further east, another two fires ignited by lightning in the Kootenay region have prompted evacuation orders for 107 properties south of Silverton, B.C. The Regional District of Central Kootenay said the Aylwin Creek and Komonko Creek blazes near the shores of Slocan Lake have reached a combined . square kilometres in size. The regional district has also issued an alert for Silverton itself, with residents told to be ready to evacuate on short notice and Highway  in the area closing due to the adjacent blazes. In northwestern B.C., the Regional District of Bulkley-Nechako has issued an evacuation order for the Laidman and Williamson lakes areas about 110 kilometres southwest of Vanderhoof. The wildfire service said skimmers and helicopters will be using local water sources in many places such as the Arrow and Kootenay lakes area as well as in the Columbia fire zone, and boaters are asked to stay away from aircraft involved in the firefighting effort. People are also being asked to stay away from firefighters’ work sites for similar safety reasons. “People using other watercraft in the intended flight path present a serious safety risk for aircrews and anyone else in the area,” the BC Wildfire Service statement says. “This behaviour is extremely dangerous and interferes with our ability to fight wildfires.” Heat warnings continue to cover a large section of south and eastern B.C., with Environment Canada reporting the Kelowna, Cranbrook, Vernon and Nakusp areas all broke high-temperature records on Friday. Highs in Kelowna reached . degrees. The federal weather agency warned the above-average temperatures will likely last into early next week. Along with the high temperatures and nearby wildfires, forecasters said smoke conditions are also expected to increase, while fires burning in Alberta are expected to bring smoke into the northeastern corner of B.C. Environment Canada has issued special statements about the wildfire smoke affecting air quality in places such as the Slocan Lake, Peace River, East Kootenay, Fort Nelson and South Thompson areas, asking residents to limit outdoor activities. BC Wildfire Service said there are almost ,000 provincial firefighters on the ground along with resources from Nova Scotia and Ontario as well as Australia and New Zealand.

The mayor of a British Columbia Interior community says the area’s long-term care residents have been moved out as a fast-moving wildfire looms nearby. Barbara Roden, mayor of Ashcroft, B.C., located about 360 kilometres northeast of Vancouver, said Saturday that community remains under an alert to be ready to evacuate on short notice. Roden said the anxiety among residents is “settling down a little bit” as the nearby Shetland Creek wildfire appeared to push northward Saturday. “In the early stages of a fire, there is of course a lot of stress, a lot of fear, a lot of nervousness,” she said. “(But) we’ve seen that the fire has largely stayed in a northerly course, not veering off to the east towards Ashcroft or Cache Creek, the more populated areas in this region.” Roden said crews have also helped the community’s psyche by keeping nearby Highway  open despite the Shetland Creek blaze growing to about 150 square kilometres in size. “The highway has remained",224,234,citynews,https://toronto.citynews.ca/2024/07/20/wildfires-erupt-in-b-c-with-more-heat-and-thunderstorms-on-the-way/,news,allenai
83," . VANCOUVER — Standing on the edge of an open aircraft hatch, a smokejumper in a pale yellow suit steadies himself before rocking back then swinging out the door and vanishing as gravity takes over. “Jumper’s away,” someone inside the plane yells as the video pans outside the window, where smoke billows toward the sky from a wildfire below. The footage is from last year at the start of what would soon become the busiest smokejumping season in the -year history of the program. Smokejumpers, also known as parattack crews, are wildland firefighters who are trained to parachute from fixed-wing aircraft, called “jumpships.” The job is thrilling, and like all firefighting comes with an element of danger, said veteran B.C. smokejumper Tom Reinboldt. But with rigorous training, he said, the goal is to “take what seems ultra-extreme and make it seem mundane.” Once on the ground, the firefighters might battle a blaze using water from a natural source, or perform other firefighting tasks like tree felling or conducting controlled burns. The BC Wildfire Service said there were “165 operational fire jumps in 2023, more than doubling the previous record of .” Reinboldt said this season is a “continuation of last year.” “It’s not quite as busy as last season, but a lot of those fires burned over the winter,” he said, adding that while there haven’t been nearly as many “initial attack starts” as there were in 2023, crews have been seeing the same types of fire behaviour. The BC Wildfire Service said on Wednesday that they have been rapidly deployed this week to cover a surge of newly discovered fires. There are only two parattack bases in Canada and both are in B.C.’s Prince George Fire Centre, one in Mackenzie and the other in Fort St. John, employing  smokejumpers. Greg Jones has been jumping for  years and now holds the title of wildfire technician spotter with the Omineca Smokejumpers. “Pretty well every crew has been busy already this year,” said Jones, based out of Mackenzie. “Not flat out like last season (was) yet, but it’s been steady.” The secret to their usefulness, Jones said, is the specialized aircraft that allow jumpers to be anywhere in the province in less than two hours. “Airplanes give us some flexibility,” he said. “The trade off there is, of course, you can’t land airplanes in the wilderness so that’s where the parachuting comes in.” As a command spotter, a main role of Jones’ job is to assess wind conditions before deploying jumpers. Wind drift indicators, or “streamers,” are tossed out of the plane by spotters. The seven-metre lengths of red and yellow crepe paper flowing in the wind allow the spotter to determine how to safety deploy jumpers. Once a location is determined, jumpers in protective Kevlar jumpsuits and caged helmets are sent out one or two at a time. The plane will circle until the jumpers are safely on the ground before more crew members are deployed. Supplies including camping gear and food and drinking water for  hours are also dropped by parachute. Jones said the firefight begins once crews are on the ground, and while their plan varies depending on the fire, they work “like every other wildfire crew.” “(It’s) some combination of either suppressing the fire directly with water and co-ordinating aerial resources using pump hose, or removing fuel from the fires path whether through ignitions or heavy equipment,” he said. “Crews are self-sufficient out in the field or on incident for  hours, and then following that, they can be resupplied as needed, whatever makes most sense,” he added. Jones said it is predetermined how the firefighters will get themselves out of a site. Sometimes, he said, they walk out. Other times, they have to clear enough space to allow a helicopter to collect them. He said he’s even been extracted via boat before. Reinboldt, who has been jumping for nearly four decades and is now based in Fort St. John, was instrumental in the implementation of parattack crews in B.C. The program has tripled in size since it began in 1998. “When we first started, we would get (between)  and  missions a year. Now an average year is probably about , a really busy year is , and last year was (about) 170.” Reinboldt held senior management positions for most of his career, but said he made sure to jump at least once a year. “I used to take my vacation to jump, so I enjoy it,” he said. After officially retiring last , Reinboldt said he lasted about four months. “It’s a very in-the-moment job, which is what I think a lot of people seek it out,” he said. “There’s not a lot of time to think about bills you have to pay or little issues that are bothering you. You have to be very focused on what you’re doing when you’re jumping out of an aircraft into a forested area that has a wildfire.” Reinboldt said the thrill and camaraderie with other crew members has kept him coming back for more than  years. “After you’ve done it enough, it’s no longer a fear thing (and) it’s more of a performance anxiety, combined with that ‘in-the-moment’ part that you like, but really, it’s being on the firelines with the crews,” he said. All firefighting is dangerous, so training is essential, he said, noting it’s no different than any other firefighting unit. Both Jones and Reinboldt say there’s a misconception that the crews are only used to access remote areas. “That’s part of what it does, but the main reason we do it is speed, range and payload,” Reinboldt said. “It’s a very quick way to get personnel and equipment to a fire and the parachutes. It’s just a solution to a problem.” Though B.C. is now the only province that employs smokejumpers, their history elsewhere in Canada dates back to the mid-20th century. Reinboldt said Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories and Yukon — where he began his smokejumping career — all had programs that have since folded. He said the program in B.C. has exceeded his expectations, but still has room to grow. “The ability to have medical response,” he said when asked what he hopes for the program’s future. For now, they are focused on the numerous fires burning across B.C. Reinboldt said he’s excited to get back jumping and smiled at he reflected on a conversation with a friend about the job. “And every once in a while, whether it’s a sunset or whatever, there’ll be a perfect moment. He said smoke jumping has an above average number of perfect moments.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published .

84," . A prominent gun-control group fears the Liberal government has abandoned its commitment to enact a comprehensive ban on assault-style firearms, citing “no tangible progress” on key steps to fulfil the pledge. In an open letter to Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, PolySeSouvient spokeswoman Nathalie Provost expresses concern that “we won’t see these measures materialize in our lifetimes” as the clock ticks toward a federal election that must be held by  of next year. A record of wasting public support and bungling various opportunities over the years would be a “devastating legacy” for the Liberals, wrote Provost, a survivor of the 1989 mass shooting at Montreal’s École Polytechnique. The group wants the government to follow through on plans to proceed with a buyback of banned assault-style firearms including the AR-, prohibit others that fell through the legislative cracks and strengthen regulations on large-capacity magazines. The office of Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said in a statement to The Canadian Press it is “continuing to put strong measures in place to tackle gun violence.” The letter from PolySeSouvient comes about a week after an assassination attempt on former U.S. president Donald Trump using what has been described as an AR--style rifle. Late last year, Parliament passed a government bill that cemented restrictions on handguns, increased penalties for firearm trafficking and aimed to curb homemade ghost guns. The legislation also included a ban on assault-style firearms that fall under a new technical definition. However, the definition didn’t apply to models that were already on the market when the bill passed. PolySeSouvient cautioned that the potential public safety benefits of most of the key measures would depend on forthcoming regulations that will flesh out the details. Conservative MPs and some gun owners have vehemently opposed the Liberal efforts to ban certain firearms as an attack on law-abiding citizens. LeBlanc has said the government will re-establish the Canadian Firearms Advisory Committee to independently review the classification of existing models that fall under the new definition of a prohibited firearm in the bill. He told senators in  the exercise would identify guns legitimately used for hunting, which would be excluded from the ban. LeBlanc said the government would also implement a long-planned buyback of firearm models and variants, including the AR- and Ruger Mini-, that were already banned through order-in-council in  2020. In addition, the government said it would enact regulations to ensure a comprehensive ban on large-capacity magazines. PolySeSouvient says tens of thousands of assault-style guns prohibited in 2020 remain in the hands of their owners, while hundreds of arbitrarily exempted models remain legal and new ones continue to enter the market. Despite federal promises and commitments, PolySeSouvient says, “there has been no tangible progress” on: revival of the advisory committee that will decide which current models should be prohibited; the planned buyback program; consultations on introduction of a pre-authorization process for new firearm models to ensure they are properly classified; or consultations on strengthening magazine regulations; Given the delays, the letter says, “we are beginning to suspect that either the Liberal government is not competent enough to deliver on its nine years of promises to ban assault weapons, or that it has abandoned its commitment to do so because it fears further stoking the wrath of the gun lobby.” In its statement, LeBlanc’s office said the government is committed to instituting a program that would provide current owners fair compensation for their assault-style firearms.

85," . MONTREAL — Officials in Montreal are struggling to get the public on board with the city’s approach to treating people with severe addiction and homelessness, as those social crises become fodder for political attacks. In Montreal’s St-Henri neighbourhood, a supervised consumption site that also provides transitional housing for homeless people with addiction or mental health issues has nearby residents fuming because it’s located near an elementary school. A few kilometres away, in downtown Montreal, another supervised drug use site has helped turn part of the district into what has become known as “crack alley.” The city is feeling the heat from residents, and in response will hold public consultations on how to integrate services for vulnerable people within urban areas. Montreal’s mayor is also getting criticized by federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who held a news conference outside St-Henri’s Maison Benoît Labre on  , saying the mayor is forcing children to go to school near a “drug den.” But there are no easy solutions, according to experts, who say people with severe drug addiction need services like supervised consumption sites — where they can be treated if they overdose — or else they risk dying on the streets. Elaine Hyshka, Canadian Research Chair in health systems innovation and associate professor at the University of Alberta, says city officials open safe-injection sites in urban areas because that’s where drug users are. These sites, she said, can’t be located in isolated parts of the city because “the vast majority of people will not go more than one kilometre to access the supervised consumption service.” François Gagnon, senior scientist and special policy adviser at the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse and Addiction, says that, ideally, safe-consumption sites wouldn’t be located near a school — but that isn’t always possible in densely populated Montreal. “In a city as dense as Montreal it’s pretty difficult to find something that’s not close to a kindergarten or to a school,” he said. But these facts don’t console André Lambert, who has lived in St. Henri for the past  years, a block away from Maison Benoît Labre. He says that since the facility opened in , his neighbourhood feels less safe. “People are scared to live around here,” Lambert said, adding that his neighbour was assaulted the previous weekend by people smoking crack on his doorstep. Lambert wants to see the centre shut down; he is part of a group of residents who have penned multiple letters to a host of Quebec officials asking for them to intervene. Waiting for the bus by Maison Benoît Labre, Marie-Ève Pelletier, who works at a nearby dental clinic, says she often gets yelled at on her way to the bus stop. “It’s always a problem when I take the bus here because I never know how the people will react because they are often aggressive.” Hyshka says people may linger outside safe-injection sites because there isn’t enough housing. Some of the sites, she said, have become “lightning rods” because they tend to be few and far between, serving large groups of people instead of being spread out across the city over a broader range of facilities. What is not helping bridge the divide between the public and vulnerable populations, Hyshka says, is that some politicians at all levels of government are “using supervised consumption services as a wedge issue to increase their popular support without thinking about the potential negative costs of their actions.” Dr. Julie Bruneau, Canada Research Chair in addiction medicine and clinical researcher at Université de Montréal, says homelessness, drug addiction and mental health issues have become much more severe and visible across Canada’s major cities since the COVID- pandemic. Supervised consumption sites like CACTUS Montréal, in so-called “crack alley” — a term used by several local media organizations in the city — are struggling because of understaffing, low-pay, precarious program funding and a lack of space to accommodate the large numbers of people who need life-saving services. The result, Bruneau says, is that in some areas people are upset to see their neighbourhoods becoming the face of social crises, especially if they have paid high prices to buy property nearby. But she says services must be provided where vulnerable people are located. Gagnon says several measures can be implemented to help prevent backlash from residents who live near supervised consumption sites. They include asking users not to leave the premises while they are highly intoxicated, organizing regular cleanups of discarded needles, and co-ordinating with police or hiring private security to maintain order around sites.

90," . CALGARY — A proposed class-action lawsuit has been filed against the City of Calgary, claiming businesses needlessly lost significant revenue due to a water main break. In a statement of claim filed Wednesday, Angel’s Cafe, located near the   water main rupture, alleges the city knew the failed pipe was made of lower-grade materials and should have moved to prevent the failure. “The city knew or ought to have known about the Bearspaw water main’s state of disrepair before the rupture and was required to take reasonable steps to prevent a catastrophic premature failure from arising,” the document says. The break in the pipe, which carries  per cent of the city’s water, caused major disruptions for the city’s . million residents and those in surrounding communities. It flooded a neighbourhood and forced a boil-water advisory in that part of the city. All residents were asked to cut their water use by  per cent. They were urged to flush toilets less often and take shorter showers. Watering lawns and gardens was forbidden for weeks, unless it was from rain barrels. The lawsuit has to be certified by the courts to proceed as a class action. Angel’s Cafe is currently the only plaintiff named in the claim. The allegations have not been proven in court. A City of Calgary spokeswoman said officials were aware of the lawsuit but had not received the statement of claim in order to comment. A spokeswoman for the city-owned utility provider Enmax Corp., also named as a defendant, said the company received the lawsuit and will assess it. The cafe’s lawyer, Clint Docken, said there’s ample evidence the pipe was in danger of failing. The lawsuit alleges there have been at least 600 previous catastrophic failures of the same kind of pipe. “These failures were well-documented and widely publicized,” the lawsuit says. The document says the pipe, which dates from the 1970s, uses reinforcing wire insufficiently protected against corrosion. The document also says the pipe uses concrete that’s porous and prone to erosion. The suit says eight additional weak spots on the pipe were uncovered during the repairs. “All of these weak points existed before the rupture and were capable of being detected by the city,” the document says. Angel’s Cafe says in the lawsuit that it was forced to remain closed on weekends that usually generate big revenue, such as Father’s Day and Canada Day. “The losses were quite remarkable,” said cafe owner Cathy Jacobs in an interview. “We’re estimating about $,000.” She said the break also forced her to cancel events such as concerts and open mike nights. The lawsuit says the cafe also suffered damage from the rupture, including a broken water heater and toilet. As well, it alleges the city failed to provide water to the cafe despite promises to do so. The suit alleges Enmax failed to provide an alternative water supply to the cafe despite a contract to provide water services. Docken said he’s heard from other area businesses that suffered similar losses. “There will be dozens of businesses in the immediate area,” he said. The pipe has since been replaced and is operating at  per cent capacity. Indoor water use has returned to normal, although a ban restricts Calgarians to watering their lawns to one hour a week.

91," . MONTREAL — It’s one of Quebec’s many idiosyncrasies that in the dog days of summer, when everyone wishes they were on holiday, virtually the entire construction industry and a good chunk of the rest of the province close up shop for two weeks. On Sunday, Quebec’s annual construction holiday will officially begin. It’s a -year-old tradition unique to the province that has a major effect on the region’s tourism industry — and on its roads. Here are five things to know about the construction holiday. It started more than half a century ago In 1970, the Quebec government mandated two weeks of summer vacation for construction workers across the province. The decree went into effect during the summer of 1971. “This ensures better co-ordination on construction sites and among the different trades that must often be present at the same time to maintain the rhythm of work,” said Johanne Brunet, a public affairs adviser at the Quebec construction commission. “It allows for a better synergy of work.” These days, the obligatory two-week vacation is enshrined in the construction industry’s collective agreements. A lot of people will go on vacation This year, almost 200,000 construction workers will be on holiday from   to . , and will receive more than $647 million in vacation pay, according to the construction commission. The two-week break also has a ripple effect across the economy. Brunet said about  per cent of Quebec’s population will take vacation during the construction holiday, more than half of whom will spend their time off in the province. A 2023 Quebec government survey found that Quebec City and the nearby Charlevoix region were the most popular tourist destinations for people travelling within the province. It’s partly a question of safety The two-week holiday comes at the hottest time of the year, Brunet explained. “It’s more and more of a health and safety issue with climate change,” she said. “It’s to give workers a break, because now, more and more, it’s not only those two weeks that are hot.” There are exceptions About  per cent of the construction workforce will be on holiday, but road work, civil engineering, emergency repairs and renovations can continue. Brunet said Quebec’s construction industry is affected by an ongoing labour shortage, and workers have put in more than 200 million hours in each of the last two years. There’s a second annual construction holiday in the winter, which stretches over Christmas and New Year’s Day. The roads can be dangerous Because of all the people heading out on vacation at the same time, the province’s automobile insurance board — Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec — is warning about a spike in car accidents at this time of year. Every year during the construction holiday, an average of  people are killed on the road, the agency says. Another  people are seriously injured and ,466 people receive minor injuries.

92," . TORONTO — Morningstar DBRS says insurance claims caused by the Toronto flood earlier this week could be “significant but manageable” for insurers. The credit rating agency says the insurance industry can expect insured losses of around $ billion from the heavy rains on   that led to flooded highways and basements. The agency says the insured losses are large for a single weather event, but they’re entirely manageable for the insurance industry. While the single event won’t disrupt the industry, insurers have been facing upward pressure on claims including more than $ billion in claims in both of the past two years. To help with all the expected claims from the flood, Ontario’s insurance regulator says it has implemented temporary measures that should speed up processing. The Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario says under the short-term measures, firms can use claims adjusters with licences outside of Ontario and insurers in the province can use the services of employees of affiliated insurers.

93," . It’s the first time The Inn at Spences Bridge has been empty since . Dorothy Boragno, who owns the inn with her husband Michael Findlay, said Friday they watched thick smoke across the Thompson River from the out-of-control Shetland Creek wildfire that has already forced others to evacuate. “We’ve been through fires before, so we know what happens, and if they get close, usually we get firemen to stay at our hotel, so we’re not too worried yet. But it does bring back bad memories,” said Boragno. The Shetland Creek fire in the southern Interior more than doubled in size from Thursday to Friday, due to what the B.C. Wildfire Service said was “significant overnight growth” and more accurate mapping. Its rapid spread was part of an eruption of wildfire activity across B.C., with the number of fires soaring past 300 on Friday afternoon, most caused by recent lightning storms, then fuelled by hot, dry weather and winds. The Shetland Creek fire is now listed at 132 square kilometres in size, up from  square kilometres, and has prompted evacuation orders and alerts in the communities of Spences Bridge, Ashcroft and part of Cache Creek, east of Kamloops. Ashcroft declared a state of local emergency on Friday and ordered eight properties be evacuated. The BC Wildfire Service says the fire advanced about six kilometres in a northwest direction parallel to Highway  Thursday night. The fire is considered a “wildfire of note” in B.C., meaning it is highly visible or poses a potential threat to public safety or infrastructure. The wildfire service says  firefighters and six helicopters are battling the blaze in addition to structure protection personnel, heavy equipment operators, and an incident management team. The Thompson-Nicola Regional District expanded an evacuation order in front of the fire on Thursday evening to cover about  properties in the Venables Valley area, while the Cook’s Ferry Indian Band has issued orders for several reserves along the Thompson River. Hundreds of other properties are subject to an evacuation alert, with the district telling them to be ready to leave on short notice. On Friday, the Village of Cache Creek issued an evacuation alert because of the fire out of an “abundance of caution.” The alert includes the Cache Creek Regional Airport and nine other properties, but the main sections of the village are not yet on alert. The Village of Ashcroft is also under an evacuation alert and Mayor Barbara Roden said Friday that the fire’s aggressive behaviour is “very concerning.” “So, residents are very on edge. They have been ever since this fire started and it was clear that it was going to be heading in this direction,” she said. “It’s been thick smoke here for the last few days even though the fire is still several kilometres away, there’s ash falling on everything here in Ashcroft.” The nearby Ashcroft Indian Band, which is also on evacuation alert, posted a notice on Facebook Friday, saying band leaders understand that “everyone is on edge with the Shetland Creek Fire burning nearby.” The statement said they are in constant contact with the BC Wildfire Service, getting updates when available and they appreciate everyone’s co-operation in conserving water they have in the reservoirs to “use in a worst-case scenario.” “In the meantime, we have our maintenance and fire mitigation crews out in the community adding more fireguards around the south and east side. As an additional piece to our regular fire mitigation practices, they are clearing debris and flammable fuels from around power poles and hydrants and we have a water tank on a trailer with hoses ready to go.” Boragno said they are also ready to get out, with a cat cage and a bag of “special stuff” ready next to the door. She said it was touching to see the whole town pull together with people helping each other out because no one likes going through this. “It brings back huge trauma for people who lost their homes and stuff,” said Boragno. Cliff Chapman with the BC Wildfire Service said Thursday the province appeared to be “on the precipice of a very challenging  hours” with hot weather, dry lightning and strong winds in the forecast. On Friday, Environment Canada issued a series of severe thunderstorm warnings for the South Peace River in the province’s northeast, Prince George, north Cariboo and Stuart-Nechako in the central Interior. A further  regions are under storm watches. The storms mostly overlap the almost  areas that are also under heat warnings, and while they may bring hail and rain, they also bring lightning and winds that can trigger and fuel fires. The heat warnings span most of the southern Interior and stretch up through central B.C. into the northeast, along with inland sections of the north and central coasts. The weather office says much of the Interior is expected to see temperatures in the 30s over the coming days, along with overnight lows in the mid-teens. For Roden, the forecast offers little hope for relief with temperatures topping  degrees, but she’s hopeful that people will remain calm and ready to leave if it comes to that. “So, you’ve got the smoke, you’ve got the ash, you’ve got the heat,” she said. “All these factors coming together are making people very edgy, very nervous. They’re remembering fires past and, and it’s the uncertainty.” Roden said the village had fires in 2017 and 2021 “on our doorstep.” “Part of my job as mayor is to try to ensure that people don’t panic,” she added. “I cannot think of any situation that has ever been improved by people panicking.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published .

95," . The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that the state is not immune from liability for drafting and enacting laws that are later found to be unconstitutional. In a ruling Friday, a majority of the top court said governments have a limited liability for laws that are found to violate the Charter. The decision paves the way for a New Brunswick man to take the federal government to court over two laws passed by the former Conservative government in 2010 and 2012. Joseph Power was convicted of criminal offences in the 1990s, served a prison sentence, and then went on to become a medical radiation technologist. He was suspended from work in 2011 when his employer learned of his criminal record, and he applied for a pardon in 2013 but was denied. Legislative changes introduced by the federal Conservatives that applied retrospectively made him permanently ineligible for a pardon and he lost his job. Power said his criminal record made it impossible for him to work in his field. However, parts of the legislation that allowed for retrospective application were later declared to be contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Power filed a legal action seeking damages, alleging the adoption and application of the legislation amounted to conduct that was clearly wrong, undertaken in bad faith and abusive of government power. Before that went to trial, the federal attorney general sought clarity on whether the Crown can be held liable for damages for drafting and enacting a bill that is later found to be unconstitutional. A judge ruled there could be liability in certain circumstances, and the decision was upheld by New Brunswick’s Court of Appeal. The federal attorney general then took its case to the Supreme Court. The case involved a lengthy list of interveners that included provinces, several First Nations and the Speakers of the House of Commons and Senate. The Supreme Court said governments can be held liable for laws that are clearly unconstitutional, were in bad faith or are an abuse of power. That high bar has been in place for more than two decades. “By shielding the government from liability in even the most egregious circumstances, absolute immunity would subvert the principles that demand government accountability,” wrote Chief Justice Richard Wagner and Justice Andromache Karakatsanis on behalf of the majority. The decision noted the importance of parliamentary privilege in Canada’s democracy, saying it gives legislatures the tools they need to carry out their core functions by, for example, ensuring lawmakers have the freedom of speech needed to do their jobs without fear of liability. However, Wagner and Karakatsanis wrote, Power’s action is against the state and not individual members of Parliament. “The state’s liability for unconstitutional legislation does not engage members’ personal immunity for parliamentary speech. Nor does it interfere with Parliament’s power to control its own debates and proceedings, or dictate how the legislative function is exercised.” The decision rejected an argument by the Attorney General of Canada that “recognized categories of parliamentary privilege extend to bar external review of every stage in the law-making process, and of all speech and all conduct by government officials or ministers related to the law-making process, including their unspoken motivations.” The court said that argument risks extending parliamentary privilege to the executive branch, “with far-reaching and unforeseeable consequences.” The court’s ruling does not delve into whether Power ought to be awarded any damages, but instead clears the way for him to proceed if he chooses to. Two justices, Nicholas Kasirer and Mahmud Jamal, wrote a partially dissenting opinion arguing that the Crown should have absolute immunity for preparing and drafting — but not enacting — an unconstitutional law. Justices Suzanne Côté and Malcolm Rowe dissented with the ruling altogether, writing that “the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation necessarily implicates parliamentary privilege, which is fundamentally at odds with awarding damages against the Crown in the manner sought.” ",4166,653," The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that the state is not immune from liability for drafting and enacting laws that are later found to be unconstitutional .

97," . TORONTO — A global technology outage grounded flights, disrupted hospitals, backed up border crossings and even upended coffee orders in Canada on Friday, as issues persisted hours after problems with Microsoft services were said to be on the mend. Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said the glitch felt round the world occurred when it deployed a faulty update to computers running Microsoft Windows — and that the outage was not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue affected Microsoft 365 apps and services, and disruptions continued after the tech company said it was gradually fixing the problem. Tens of thousands of devices were knocked out in B.C.’s health sector, temporarily sending hospitals back to the pen-and-paper era. Provincial health authorities in Newfoundland also reported disruptions, as did several major Ontario hospitals. Major Canadian companies, including Porter Airlines and Telus, also said operations had been affected. Brent Arnold, a Toronto-based cybersecurity and technology lawyer, called Friday’s outage a software update gone wrong. “This may be, I think, the biggest-scale one that we’ve seen,” said Arnold, a partner at Gowling WLG. Porter Airlines, which initially grounded flights until noon, extended cancellations until  p.m. EDT due to the outage. By : p.m., the country’s third-largest airline had scrapped  flights, or  per cent of its 212 scheduled takeoffs, according to aviation data firm Cirium. More than ,000 customers were affected, and its website was down until mid-afternoon, with some disruptions continuing into the evening. Martin Bertrand, who was slated to fly Porter from Toronto to the U.S. for a weekend trip with his wife, said his plans had been thrown into limbo. “We’re kind of disappointed that this whole thing happened,” he said in an interview from Toronto Island’s Billy Bishop Airport. “We’re still in the dark. So, we’re trying to figure out if there’s a glimmer of hope for us.” Allan Friedland, who was set to fly from Billy Bishop to New Jersey for a family gathering, said he had to rebook on an Air Canada flight out of Toronto Pearson International Airport. “We should hopefully make it,” he said. At Pearson airport, as well as the main airports in Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal, the vast majority of arrivals and departures between Canada and the U.S. were postponed or called off. Passengers at Pearson saw early morning departures to cities including Houston, Denver and Washington, D.C., delayed for up to five hours. Flights from Chicago and Newark, N.J., were cancelled. U.S. airlines were among the carriers affected, including United and Delta Air Lines, which have partnerships with Air Canada and WestJet, respectively. However, the fact the outage occurred overnight meant fewer flights were affected, with airlines’ IT systems back up and running by sunrise on the East Coast. “From a global perspective, the impact in Canada is pretty minimal compared to what happened in other parts of the world,” said aviation consultant Duncan Dee, pointing to widespread disarray and what some observers described as chaos at airports in parts of Europe and Asia. Some travellers will likely have to wait up to  hours before they reach their destinations, Dee said, “not to mention the rolling delays that will occur as a result of this.” Not even Starbucks was spared from the fallout. The coffee chain said its mobile order-ahead and pay features were temporarily out of order. “I don’t know what’s worse,” traveller Robert Harris said in a social media post from Pearson, “the ground stoppage or the fact that the Starbucks order ahead isn’t working. Both are causing massive lines.” Disruptions extended to health care, government offices and other agencies. University Health Network in Toronto, one of Canada’s largest hospital networks, said some of its systems were affected by the outage before coming back online by : p.m. In a social media post, it said clinical activity continued but some delays were possible. Toronto’s Sunnybrook Hospital also reported it had been affected by the outage, while St. Joseph’s Healthcare said its Hamilton hospital remained open as it worked on a fix for its IT systems. Arnold, the Toronto cybersecurity lawyer, said the outage was a startling reminder of how dependent companies in Canada and around the world have become on just a handful of operating systems. “We have also become more vulnerable because of that concentration in just a few companies and a few pieces of vital technology,” he said. “It’s probably going to be days or weeks before we understand the full impact.” In British Columbia, some ,000 devices at the province’s hospitals and health facilities were put out of commission for hours, forcing staff to pivot to paper to manage everything from lab work to meal orders. Health Minister Adrian Dix said Friday afternoon that systems were beginning to come back online after experts jumped on the problem, which had “a profound impact on staff” but a limited effect on patients. B.C. Premier David Eby said health workers now faced the burden of transferring paper files to electronic health records. The government of Newfoundland and Labrador advised users of its digital platforms of possible service disruptions, including to the main information system used to manage patient care and financial information at the provincial health authority. The outage reached the border too. The Canada Border Services Agency said its telephone reporting system — primarily used by small aircraft passengers and boaters — suffered a partial systems outage that was resolved by midday. Earlier on Friday, Windsor police reported long delays at Canada-U.S. border crossings at both the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit-Windsor tunnel. Meanwhile, banks in Canada were “reviewing the situation based on updates from their technology partners,” a spokeswoman for the Canadian Bankers Association said. “Any current impacts on banking services would be temporary,” Maggie Cheung said in a statement. Calvin Watt, who said he held an investment account with RBC, said he was unable to make any trades Friday morning. “Nothing is able to go through,” he said, speaking in the lobby of a downtown Toronto office building. “I am still not able to make trades.” One major Canadian telecommunications carrier had some difficulties due to the outage. Some Telus employees were unable to access “the tools and systems necessary to support our customers,” a spokeswoman said Friday. Bell and Rogers, two of the other major carriers, said their networks were unaffected. Canada Post said a small number of post offices across the country appeared to be affected by the outage, calling the impact to customers “minimal.” The problem hit the theatre world as well. Mirvish Productions said Friday morning its online, phone and in-person ticket sales were unavailable, with no update as of late afternoon. Shortly after noon, Microsoft 365 posted on social media platform X that “the issue is mitigated, and all previously impacted Microsoft 365 apps and service have recovered.” CrowdStrike said the problem boiled down to “a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts.” “This is not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed,” it wrote in a statement. John Gradek, who teaches aviation management at McGill University, said the incident should serve as a “warning sign” to airlines and companies across the globe. “There’s no such thing as a fool-proof solution.” — With files from Christopher Reynolds, Maan Alhmidi, Sharif Hassan, Sammy Hudes, Ashley Joannou and The Associated Press This report by The Canadian Press was first published .
